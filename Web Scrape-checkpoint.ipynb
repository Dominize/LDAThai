      "   Norges Bank's press conference of 13 December 2000 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 13 December. Norges Bank’s key rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 7.00 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. Norges Bank does not have the instruments to fine-tune the exchange rate, but when setting interest rates the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability: price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank’s inflation reports, together with its continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide the basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank’s assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 28 September in the September 2000 Inflation Report. The Bank’s December 2000 Inflation Report is being prepared, and will be presented on 21 December. There is little risk of a deflationary recession. Norges Bank has not changed its assessment of the effects of the budget, as expressed in the Bank’s submission of 19 October 2000 to the Ministry of Finance, the “Budget Submission”. Projections for real underlying growth in government budget expenditure and the tax programme indicate that fiscal policy will entail somewhat higher price inflation in the short term than previously estimated. On the other hand, slower economic growth will have the opposite effect. The effective import-weighted krone exchange rate, which is an indicator of international price impulses affecting the Norwegian economy, has strengthened somewhat since the last monetary policy meeting on 1 November, but is almost 3 per cent weaker than it was at the beginning of 2000. The krone has depreciated against the euro since the November meeting and is at approximately the same level as at the beginning of the year. The expected slowdown in world economic growth now appears to have commenced, and interest rate expectations have therefore been revised downwards in a number of countries. In the euro area, the UK and the US, market participants are expecting somewhat lower interest rates. In Sweden, the marginal lending rate was raised last week, and further interest rate increases are expected during the first half of 2001. Price inflation in Norway is high. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index was 3.2 per cent in November. Underlying price inflation, ie excluding indirect taxes and changes in electricity prices and adjusted for the revision of the house rent index, stood at 3.0 per cent in November. If the direct effect of the petrol price is also excluded, price inflation was 2.6 per cent. The credit supply continues to grow substantially, although the growth rate slowed in October. The labour market is tight. In recent years, labour costs in the business sector have risen at a considerably faster pace than wage growth in the euro area countries. This trend will continue this year and in 2001. High labour cost increases in Norway are contributing to maintaining price inflation at a high level. On the other hand, the national accounts for the third quarter indicate that growth in the Norwegian economy is slowing. House prices appear to be stabilising. Growth in goods consumption has moderated. The slowdown in the global economy will also contribute to reducing growth in demand. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be a reduction is the same as the probability of an increase.      Norges Bank's press conference of 1 November 2000 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 1 November. The interest rate on banks’ sight deposits with Norges Bank and the overnight lending rate therefore remain at 7.00 per cent and 9.00 per cent respectively.

Norges Bank will analyse developments more closely in the Inflation Report to be presented in December. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be a reduction is the same as the probability of an increase.     Norges Bank's press conference of 20 September 2000 At today's meeting, Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to increase the interest rate on banks' sight deposits and the overnight lending rate by 0.25 percentage point with effect from 21 September. The deposit rate and overnight lending rate will hence be 7.00 per cent and 9.00 per cent respectively. Today's decision to raise interests rates brings the overall increase in interest rates to 1.5 percentage points over the past six months. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. Norges Bank does not have the instruments to fine-tune the exchange rate, but when setting interest rates the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability: price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank's inflation reports, together with its continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide the basis for decisions regarding monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank's assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 22 June in the June 2000 Inflation Report. Norway's trading partners are still experiencing robust economic growth, but high oil prices may gradually moderate the expansion. The prospect of higher price inflation has led to an increase in interest rates in EMU countries and subsequently Denmark. Market participants expect key rates to be raised in the euro area and some other European countries. The krone exchange rate has appreciated somewhat against the euro since Norges Bank's Executive Board held its monetary policy meeting on 9 August. The effective krone exchange rate, which is a better indicator of international price impulses to the Norwegian economy, has also appreciated somewhat, but less than the krone exchange rate against the euro. The effective krone exchange rate is still weaker than at the beginning of the year. Price inflation has increased. The year-on-year rate of increase in consumer prices was 3.5 per cent in August. Underlying price inflation, ie excluding indirect taxes and changes in electricity prices and adjusted for the revision of the house rent index, stood at 3.1 per cent in August, up from 2.4 per cent in January this year. Increases in petrol prices have been a contributing factor. The labour market is tight. Employment growth has been higher than expected. Unemployment is now at approximately the same level as in the first part of 1999. The economy has shown renewed growth, following a pause from summer 1998 to summer 1999. Traditional merchandise imports are rising, and housing investment has picked up. Private consumption is expanding, buoyed by strong credit growth and high house prices. The latest figures on private consumption indicate, however, that growth may slow somewhat. The interest rate increases so far this year will gradually contribute to curbing the rise in demand and prices. The September 2000 Inflation Report is currently being prepared and will be presented in one week. There seems to be little risk of a downturn in the economy. It appears that price inflation in 2001 may be somewhat higher than projected in June, primarily as a result of a high oil price. Price and cost inflation may slow somewhat in the period ahead, and the rate of increase in prices in 2002 may be lower than projected in June. This is partly based on the assumption of a neutral fiscal policy. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be a reduction is the same as the probability of an increase.      Norges Bank's press conference of 9 August 2000 At today's meeting, Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to increase the interest rate on banks' sight deposits and the overnight lending rate by 0.50 percentage point with effect from 10 August. The deposit rate and overnight lending rate will hence be 6.75 per cent and 8.75 per cent respectively. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be an increase is greater than the probability of a reduction. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. When setting interest rates, the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability. Price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank's inflation reports, together with its continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide the basis for decisions regarding monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank's assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 22 June in the Inflation Report. In the report, Norges Bank revised upwards its projections for price and cost inflation in the years ahead. Consumer price inflation was forecast at 3 per cent in 2000 and 2½ per cent in 2001 and 2002. Recent international and domestic developments support the picture presented in the June Inflation Report. The international upswing now appears to have gained a broad footing, which is generating positive impulses to Norwegian exports. Stronger growth rates and nascent signs of a faster rate of increase in prices have pushed up short rates internationally since the beginning of the year. Central banks have raised their key rates and market participants expect further increases in interest rates in a number of countries. The krone exchange rate has appreciated slightly against the euro since Norges Bank's Executive Board last held its monetary policy meeting on 14 June. Norges Bank does not have the instruments to fine-tune the exchange rate, but when setting interest rates the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability over time, ie that price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area. In the short term, the effective krone exchange rate is more relevant as an indicator of international price impulses to the Norwegian economy. Measured by the broad import-weighted exchange rate index the krone has depreciated by about 3 per cent since the beginning of the year. The krone exchange rate is thus somewhat weaker than assumed in the June Inflation Report. The year-on-year rate of increase in domestic consumer prices was 3.3 per cent in June. Underlying price inflation, ie excluding changes in electricity prices and indirect taxes and adjusted for the revision of the house rent index, was 3.1 per cent. The labour market is tight. The additional vacation days and increased use of various pension arrangements will contribute to restraining the supply of labour over the next two years. Our assessment points to higher growth in wage costs in Norway than in euro area countries. Private consumption and the supply of credit are on the rise. House prices showed a marked increase in the first half of the year. Output growth in parts of the manufacturing sector is weak and investment activity sluggish, although there are renewed signs of higher growth in credit to the enterprise sector. The high cost level currently prevailing in the business sector may have a dampening impact on growth in the years ahead. However, in the short term there is little risk of a downturn in the economy as a whole. Today's decision to raise interests rates brings the overall increase in interest rates to 1.25 percentage points from the beginning of the year. This represents a substantial step in the adjustment of the interest rate that is appropriate on the basis of the analyses in the June Inflation Report. However, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be an increase remains greater than the probability of a reduction.      Norges Bank's press conference of 14 June 2000 Norges Bank's Executive Board has today decided to increase the interest rate on banks' sight deposits and the overnight lending rate by 0.50 percentage point with effect from 15 June. The deposit rate will then be 6.25 per cent and the overnight lending rate will be 8.25 per cent. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be an increase is greater than the probability of a reduction. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. When setting interest rates, the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability. Price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank's inflation reports, together with a regular assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide a basis for decisions regarding monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank's assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 23 March in the March 2000 Inflation Report. The June 2000 Inflation Report is currently being prepared and will be presented in one week. The international economy is expanding rapidly. Short-term international interest rates have risen markedly since the beginning of the year. Central banks have raised their key rates, and market participants expect further increases in a number of countries. The effective krone exchange rate, measured by the import-weighted krone exchange rate against 44 countries, has depreciated by nearly 5 per cent since the start of the year. The krone has depreciated by some 2.5 per cent against the euro in the same period. Consumer prices in Norway rose by 2.8 per cent in the last twelve months to May. Underlying price inflation, which excludes electricity prices, indirect tax changes and adjusts for the changeover to a monthly house rent index, was 2.6 per cent. The labour market is tight. Reforms are curbing labour supply. The wage settlement suggests that the rise in labour costs will be considerably higher than in the euro area. Movements in the krone exchange rate may contribute to increases in prices for imported goods. Private consumption is rising and growth in credit to households has increased since the beginning of the year. House prices have risen appreciably. Petroleum investment, however, appears to be lower than previously expected. The investment intentions survey for the second quarter indicates that manufacturing investment will continue to contract next year. Imports are sluggish, underpinning the impression of a low level of investment activity. The management of the central government's expenditure and revenues, as expressed inter alia in connection with the Revised National Budget for 2000, is contributing to lower pressure in the domestic economy than we would otherwise have experienced. On the whole, the changes in economic prospects suggest that there will be slightly stronger price and cost pressures in the Norwegian economy than we estimated in the March 2000 Inflation Report.      Norges Bank's press conference of 10 May 2000 Norges Bank's Executive Board did not decide to change interest rates at its meeting today. Hence, the interest rate on banks' sight deposits with Norges Bank and the overnight lending rate remain at 5.75 per cent and 7.75 per cent, respectively. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. When setting interest rates, the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability. Price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank's inflation reports, together with a regular assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide a basis for decisions regarding monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank's assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 23 March in the March 2000 Inflation Report. In the report, consumer price inflation was projected at 2¾ per cent in 2000 and 2 per cent in 2001. For 2002, the rate of increase in consumer prices was estimated at 2¼ per cent. Mainland GDP was projected to expand by 1½ per cent in 2000, 2 per cent in 2001 and 2¼ per cent in 2002. The krone exchange rate against the euro has been relatively stable. The krone has depreciated against the US dollar, pound sterling and the Swedish krona. The effective krone exchange rate has depreciated by a little more than 4 per cent since the beginning of the year. Short-term interest rates have risen both in Norway and other countries. A number of central banks have raised their key rates. The outcome of the wage negotiations in the private sector points to a somewhat stronger increase in the cost of labour in 2000 and 2001 compared with the estimates in the March Inflation Report. However, there is still considerable uncertainty concerning wage developments, notably with regard to wage growth in the public sector and wage drift in the private sector. Consumer prices in Norway rose by 2.6 per cent in the twelve months to April. Underlying price inflation, which excludes electricity prices, indirect tax changes and adjusts for the changeover to a monthly house rent index, was 2.3 per cent. Economic developments among our trading partners are favourable. This is generating an impetus to Norwegian exports, which are expanding at a rapid pace. Short-term statistics indicate that domestic demand remains buoyant. Unemployment remains low. House prices are still rising. Growth in credit to households has increased and private consumption is growing sharply. On the other hand, petroleum investment is expected to contract this year. Growth in credit to the enterprise sector is declining. Commercial property prices are rising slowly. There are no signs of renewed growth in business investment. However, there is little risk of a downturn in the economy as a whole in the short term. Norges Bank raised its key rates by 0.25 percentage point one month ago. In the light of recent trends in economic developments and in the balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be an increase is currently greater than the probability of a reduction.      Norges Bank's press conference of 12 April 2000 Norges Bank's Executive Board has today decided to increase the interest rate on banks' deposits with Norges Bank, the deposit rate, by 0.25 percentage point with effect from Thursday, 13 April 2000. The interest rate on central bank overnight loans to banks will also be increased by 0.25 percentage point. The deposit rate will be 5.75 per cent and the overnight lending rate will be 7.75 per cent starting from 13 April. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. When setting interest rates, the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability. Price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank's inflation reports, together with a continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide a basis for decisions regarding monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank's assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 23 March in the March 2000 Inflation Report. In the report, consumer price inflation is projected at 2¾ per cent in 2000 and 2 per cent in 2001. For 2002, the rate of increase in consumer prices is estimated at 2¼ per cent. Mainland GDP is projected to expand by 1½ per cent in 2000 and 2 per cent in 2001. In 2002, growth is expected to be broadly in line with trend growth of 2¼ per cent. The krone exchange rate against the euro has been relatively stable since the beginning of the year. However, the krone has recently depreciated against the US dollar, pound sterling and the Swedish krona in particular. This has contributed to a weakening of the trade-weighted index of a good 2 per cent since the beginning of the year. Short-term interest rates have been edging up both in Norway and other countries. Since the last change in Norges Bank's interest rates, key rates have been raised in many countries. Market participants expect several central banks to raise interest rates in the period ahead. Developments both internationally and in Norway underline the picture described in the last Inflation Report. Economic developments among our trading partners are favourable. This will provide an impetus to Norwegian exports, which are expanding at a rapid pace. Consumer prices in Norway rose by 2.5 per cent in the twelve months to March, which was broadly in line with expectations. Underlying price inflation, excluding electricity prices and indirect tax changes and adjusted for the changeover to a monthly house rent index, was 2.4 per cent. The recommended proposal for employees covered by the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry implies a level of cost inflation in line with the projection in the Inflation Report. Short-term statistics show that private consumption is increasing. House prices are still rising. Growth in credit to households remains high. On the other hand, petroleum investment is expected to contract this year. Weak corporate profitability may contribute to restraining mainland fixed investment. In addition, there has recently been a correction in stock markets after a sustained period of sharp gains in equity prices. There seems to be little risk of a downturn in the economy. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be an increase is greater than the probability of a reduction.     Norges Bank's press conference of 16 March 2000 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 16 March. The interest rate on banks' sight deposits with Norges Bank and the overnight lending rate therefore remain at 5.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. When setting interest rates, the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability. Price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank's inflation reports, together with its continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide the basis for decisions regarding monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank's assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 16 December in the December 1999 Inflation Report. The krone exchange rate against the euro has been relatively stable since the beginning of the year. The krone has weakened somewhat against the US dollar, pound sterling and the Swedish krona. This has resulted in a depreciation of the krone measured by the trade-weighted index. Short-term interest rates have edged up both in international markets and the domestic market, while long rates have drifted down since the beginning of the year. A number of central banks have tightened monetary policy since the beginning of the year. Market participants expect central banks in several countries to take further measures in the period ahead with a view to preventing higher inflation. So far, developments both internationally and in Norway have deviated somewhat from the projections presented in the December Inflation Report. In Norway, consumer price inflation was 3.2 per cent in February. In recent months, price inflation has been slightly higher than expected. The rise in oil prices has pushed up inflation in Norway and abroad. The quarterly national accounts for the fourth quarter of 1999 indicate that economic growth was markedly higher in the second half of 1999. So far this year, short-term statistics suggest that economic growth will be higher than projected. House prices are rising. Domestic credit growth remains high and household consumption has picked up. There are also clear signs of higher growth in the global economy. Traditional merchandise exports have increased in recent months, and prices for Norwegian export goods have edged up. On the other hand, petroleum investment in Norway is expected to contract further this year. Weak corporate profitability in 1999 may contribute to restraining fixed investment in general. The effect of high oil prices on international developments is uncertain, but the effect on price inflation may lead to higher interest rates. A correction in share prices may also have an impact on developments in the real economy. Norges Bank will present its Inflation Report for the first quarter of 2000 in one week. The report is now being drafted but evidence suggests that both economic growth and price inflation may be somewhat higher over the next two years than projected in the December Inflation Report. There seems to be little risk of a downturn. Norges Bank has left its key rates unchanged since September 1999. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be an increase is greater than the probability of a reduction.     Norges Bank's press conference of 16 February 2000 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 16 February. The interest rate on banks' sight deposits with Norges Bank and the overnight lending rate therefore remain at 5.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. When setting interest rates, the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability. Price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by euro area countries. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank's inflation reports, together with its continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide the basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank's assessment of the economic outlook was last presented on 16 December in the December 1999 Inflation Report. These analyses indicate that over time price inflation will be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area countries. Projections reflect that pressures in the labour market will ease, resulting in lower wage inflation in 2000 and 2001 than in 1999. There seems to be little risk of a pronounced downturn. Throughout February the krone exchange rate against the euro has been slightly stronger than in January. The krone has weakened against both the US dollar and pound sterling. Measured against the trade-weighted index, the krone has been stable. Key rates have been raised in many countries. The ECB and the central banks in the US, the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong have raised their key rates by ¼-½ percentage point. Long-term interest rates have edged down both internationally and in the Norwegian market. Consumer price inflation was 2.9 per cent in January. Price inflation has slightly exceeded expectations in recent months. This is partly due to temporary and random factors. House prices are still rising. Credit growth remains strong. Quarterly national accounts for the fourth quarter of 1999 indicate that economic growth picked up in the last half of 1999. The growth rate of the Norwegian economy at the beginning of 2000 may therefore have been somewhat higher than projected in the December Inflation Report. There are also signs of stronger economic growth internationally. On the other hand, a number of developments still confirm the anticipated slowdown in the Norwegian economy. Unemployment is edging up and petroleum investment is declining. Imports are moving on a weak trend. Signs of low earnings in the enterprise sector may contribute to restraining fixed investment. It is also uncertain how high oil prices will affect international developments. New data received since the December Inflation Report point to stronger growth internationally and in Norway than projected in the December report. Norges Bank has left interest rates unchanged since September last year. As we judge the risks at present, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be a reduction is equal to the probability that it will be an increase.      Norges Bank keeps its key interest rates unchanged Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting of 19 January.The interest rate on banks' sight deposits with Norges Bank and the overnight lending rate therefore remain at 5.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. The objective of monetary policy is a stable krone exchange rate against European currencies, defined since the beginning of the year as the euro.Norges Bank does not have the instruments to fine-tune the krone exchange rate. In its orientation of instruments, the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability.Price and cost inflation must therefore be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area.At the same time, it must be ensured that monetary policy itself does not contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank's inflation reports, in conjunction with its continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide the basis for decisions regarding monetary policy instruments.Norges Bank's assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 16 December in the December 1999 Inflation Report. The overall picture is that the economy is in a period of slow economic growth. This risk of a pronounced downturn seems to have receded compared with previous assessments.Growth in the various sectors is expected to vary, with a downturn in the manufacturing sector, but continued growth in the services sector.The analyses in the Inflation Report indicate that price inflation will, over time, slow to the level aimed at by the euro area. The krone exchange rate against the euro has weakened slightly over the past month, varying between NOK 8.06 and NOK 8.22.Measured against the trade-weighted index, the krone has been stable. Long-term interest rates have moved up slightly internationally and in the Norwegian market.Consumer price inflation was 2.8 per cent in December, reflecting rising electricity prices.The underlying rise in prices, which excludes changes in electricity prices and indirect taxes, were in line with projections, showing a year-on-year increase of 2.5 per cent. Twelve-month growth in the money supply (M2) and credit from domestic sources (C2) moved up to 8.6 per cent and 8.0 per cent respectively in November. The increase in growth in the money supply may in part reflect extraordinary liquidity demand in connection with the turn of the year. Norges Bank reduced its deposit and lending rates by a total of 2.5 percentage points in 1999.In the light of developments indicated by our analyses, interest rates now appear to be at or close to the trough in this business cycle.     Norges Bank&#8217;s press conference of 12 December 2001 Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce the key rate, the sight deposit rate, by 0.50 percentage point with effect from tomorrow, 13 December 2001. The sight deposit rate will then be 6.5 per cent. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. Changes in the interest rate are normally made gradually. The analyses in Norges Bank’s Inflation Report, together with the Bank’s current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. In Norges Bank’s October Inflation Report, the rise in consumer prices two years ahead, with unchanged interest rates, was estimated at 2½ percent. The Inflation Report indicated that there is uncertainty surrounding the inflation projection. All in all, the Bank’s assessment was that the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. International economic developments are marked by a synchronised downturn in the US, Japan and Europe. Central banks in a number of countries have reduced their key rates. In the US, the UK and Sweden, taxes have been lowered and public expenditures increased to stimulate the economy. The most likely scenario is that economic policy will contribute to a resumption of growth next year. However, there is still a risk of a deep, more prolonged downturn in the global economy. This would lead to weaker economic developments and lower-than-estimated price inflation, also in Norway. In addition, the oil market is unstable with a tendency towards lower prices. Some sectors of Norwegian industry are now experiencing falling demand in export markets. The position of Norwegian enterprises has also weakened due to substantial cost increases in recent years. Unemployment has edged up. On the other hand, household finances are solid. Credit growth to the household sector is still strong. It appears that house prices will remain high. Consumer prices, excluding changes in excise duties and energy prices, rose by 2.5 per cent in the twelve-month period to November. Real wage growth and tax reductions indicate that consumption growth will continue. According to Norges Bank’s assessment, with an interest rate of 6.5 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is still greater than the probability that it will be higher.      Norges Bank's press conference of 31 October 2001 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 31 October. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 7.00 per cent. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. Changes in the interest rate are normally made gradually. The analyses in Norges Bank’s Inflation Report, together with the Bank’s current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. In the Inflation Report that is being presented today, the rise in consumer prices two years ahead, with unchanged interest rates, is estimated at 2½ per cent. This projection is consistent with the inflation target of 2½ per cent. However, as discussed in the report, there is considerable uncertainty associated with the inflation projection. Domestically generated inflationary impulses remain strong in Norway. Demand for labour in the sheltered sector is high. Increased strains in the labour market are exerting pressure on the traditional wage determination process. This implies a risk of higher-than-estimated wage and price inflation. We have based our assessment of fiscal policy on the central government budget for 2002, as presented by the previous Government, and a use of petroleum revenues that is in line with the new guidelines for fiscal policy. The new Government will present its budget proposal on 9 November. This is the first budget based on the new guidelines for the use of petroleum revenues. Uncertainty surrounding global developments is unusually high. The terrorist attacks of 11 September may have influenced behaviour and response patterns in such a way that historical experience is no longer a reliable guide. The projections in the Inflation Report are based on the assumption that growth in the global economy will pick up again through 2002. There is a clear risk, however, that the downturn in the global economy may be deeper and longer. This would lead to weaker economic developments and lower-than-estimated price inflation, also in Norway. In the light of the balance of risks as presented in the Inflation Report, it is now Norges Bank’s assessment that the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. Starting with this issue, the Inflation Report has been given a somewhat different structure from previous reports, a structure that we think is more appropriate in relation to our new mandate for monetary policy. A statistical annex with longer time series for reference purposes represents another new feature. As previously, the Central Bank Governor is editor of the report. The main elements of the Inflation Report are presented to and discussed by the members of the Executive Board before they are published. And, as I have already mentioned, the projections and analyses in the Inflation Report serve as an important basis for the Executive Board’s discussion and setting of interest rates.      Norges Bank's press conference of 19 September 2001 The tragic events in the US on 11 September will contribute to a further dampening of activity in the American, Asian and European economies. It is too early to predict the long-term effects. Reactions in financial markets have been pronounced. Share prices have fallen sharply. Government bond yields have declined, particularly at the short end of the maturity spectrum. The US dollar has depreciated against the euro and the Japanese yen. Currencies of other economies such as Sweden have depreciated as a result of the change in growth prospects. The currencies of New Zealand and Australia have also weakened. Assets that are perceived as particularly safe, such as the Swiss franc and gold, have risen in value. Central banks have ensured the smooth functioning of markets by supplying liquidity to the banking system. Interest rates have been cut in the US, Canada, the euro area, Switzerland, Sweden, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Denmark, Japan, the UK, New Zealand and Korea. These cuts will contribute to mitigating the negative effects on demand, output and employment. For Norway, the effects of the international economic contraction are different from the impact on other European countries because oil prices remain high. So far, mainland businesses have not been heavily influenced by the slowdown in world economic growth, but the environment has now become more uncertain for several industries. The rate of increase in import prices is expected to remain low in the period ahead. The krone exchange rate has appreciated. The Norwegian economy is characterised by high capacity utilisation and high cost inflation. The mainland economy appears to be expanding approximately in line with growth in output potential. At present, we do not have sufficient evidence to assert that international developments will change this situation as long as oil prices remain high. House prices and household borrowing are rising at a rapid pace. The announced increase in spending of petroleum revenues could lead to a more expansionary fiscal stance than in recent years. Consumer price inflation was 2.7 per cent in August. For a number of years, Norges Bank has published its own projections for underlying price inflation, i.e. price inflation excluding changes in excise duties and energy prices. For August, underlying price inflation was projected at 2½ per cent. As of next month, Statistics Norway will publish the same type of price index. As stated in the press release published earlier today, Norges Bank has left the key rate, the deposit rate, unchanged at 7.00 per cent. According to Norges Bank’s assessment, with an unchanged interest rate ahead, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower.     Norges Bank's press conference of 8 August 2001 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 8 August. Norges Bank’s key rate, the sight deposit rate, remains at 7.00 per cent. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank’s Inflation Report, together with the Bank’s current assessment of the inflation outlook and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank’s assessment of the outlook for developments in the Norwegian economy was last presented in the Inflation Report published on 20 June. Price inflation was estimated at 2½ per cent in 2003, assuming that the interest rate remains unchanged. The risk picture is mixed. The Norwegian economy is still characterised by high capacity utilisation. The labour market is tight. Consumer price inflation rose by a year-on-year rate of 3.8 per cent in June. Excluding the direct effects of changes in excise duties and energy prices, price inflation was about 2.5 per cent. Credit growth is high and the growth rate of household demand for loans continues to increase. There is a risk that domestic pressures will gradually translate into stronger-than-estimated inflationary impulses. On the other hand, it appears that global economic developments will be weaker than expected. Although business and industry have been sheltered so far from the slowdown in the world economy, the Norwegian economy may gradually be more strongly affected. Sluggish growth in the global economy may reduce the demand for Norwegian goods and ease the pressures in the Norwegian economy. The international slowdown may also curb imported price inflation. In this case, price inflation may be lower than we have estimated. According to Norges Bank’s assessment, with an unchanged interest rate ahead, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower.      Norges Bank's press conference of 20 June 2001 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 20 June. Norges Bank's key rate, the sight deposit rate, remains at 7.00 per cent. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank's Inflation Report, together with its current assessment of the inflation outlook and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. The analyses in the Inflation Report presented today indicate that at the current interest rate level there are prospects for achieving the inflation target over the next two years. However, the risk picture is mixed. Capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy remains high. There is a shortage of labour and labour costs are rising at a fairly rapid pace. Consumer price inflation has picked up, rising by a year-on-year rate of 4.3 per cent in May. Excluding the direct effects of changes in excise duties and energy prices, price inflation was about 2.7 per cent. The financial position of households is solid and credit growth remains high. Against this background, there is a risk that domestic pressures will translate into stronger-than-estimated inflationary impulses. On the other hand, the slowdown in world economic growth has been substantial, and there is a risk of slower growth and a longer downturn. Norwegian industries have so far been sheltered to a greater extent than usual from international developments. This applies to the oil industry, and also to export industries such as aluminium production and the fish farming industry. If there is a new wave of negative news about global economic developments, the effects on the Norwegian economy may be stronger. This could also curb the rise in prices compared with our estimates. The krone is now stronger than the technical assumption underlying the analyses in the Inflation Report. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with an unchanged interest rate ahead the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower.     Norges Bank's press conference of 16 May 2001 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 16 May. Norges Bank's key rate, the sight deposit rate, remains at 7.00 per cent. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2.5 per cent. Monetary policy affects the economy with considerable and variable lags, and the Bank must thus be forward-looking in its interest-rate setting. The key rate is set on the basis of the inflation outlook, normally for a few years ahead. Changes in the interest rate will be made gradually so that the Bank may assess the effects of interest rate changes and other new information on economic developments. If the inflation outlook deviates substantially from the target for a period, Norges Bank will set the interest rate with a view to gradually returning consumer price inflation to the target. The use of instruments may be more extensive if the economy and the inflation outlook are exposed to considerable disturbances stemming for example from developments in the international economy or the oil market. A more extensive use of instruments could also prove to be appropriate if for example heightening turbulence in financial markets or a cost-push shock resulting from negotiations indicate that confidence in monetary policy is in jeopardy. Norges Bank will seek to clarify its response pattern. With a credible inflation target, Norges Bank may achieve nominal stability with less fluctuation in the real economy. The analyses in Norges Bank's Inflation Report, together with its current assessment of the inflation outlook and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide the basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank's assessment of the outlook for economic developments was last presented in the Inflation Report published on March 8. Price inflation was projected at 2 per cent in 2003 based on the assumption of unchanged interest rates. However, the projections for economic developments must be assessed in the light of the new guidelines for economic policy of 29 March (see Norges Bank's press release of 29 March). The new inflation target may influence the projections through inflation expectations. The phasing in of petroleum revenues from 2002 as described in the Government's Long-Term Programme will also have an effect. The inflation projections presented in the March Inflation Report were based on the technical assumption of a neutral fiscal stance. Global economic growth is slowing and there is substantial uncertainty associated with developments ahead. The Federal Reserve has reduced the target for the federal funds rate by a total of 2.5 percentage points since the beginning of the year. Interest rate cuts have also been made in a number of other countries. The Norwegian economy is marked by high capacity utilisation. The labour market is very tight. This increases the risk of higher-than-projected cost inflation. House prices have risen at a faster pace than expected. The credit supply remains high. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index was 3.8 per cent in April. Excluding changes in indirect taxes and electricity and petrol prices, price inflation was about 2½ per cent. Measured by the import-weighted krone exchange rate index, the krone appreciated by 1.8 per cent in relation to that assumed in the March Inflation Report. In isolation, this will have a dampening impact on external price impulses. On balance, domestic developments suggest a tighter monetary policy stance. On the other hand, international developments with the possibility of a pronounced and prolonged downturn may lead to lower-than-expected inflation. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in the interest rate will be a reduction is the same as the probability of an increase.     Norges Bank's press conference of 4 April 2001 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 4 April. Norges Bank's key rate, the sight deposit rate, remains at 7.00 per cent. The Government laid down a new regulation on monetary policy on 29 March 2001. According to the regulation, monetary policy shall be oriented towards low and stable inflation, with an inflation target of 2½ per cent. In its submission of 27 March to the Ministry of Finance, Norges Bank stated the following with regard to its conduct of monetary policy: \"Consequently, the Bank must be forward-looking in its interest-rate setting. The effects of interest rate changes are uncertain and vary over time. Changes in the interest rate will be made gradually so that the Bank may assess the effects of interest rate changes and other new information on economic developments. If price inflation deviates substantially from the target for a period, Norges Bank will set the interest rate with a view to gradually returning consumer price inflation to the target. Norges Bank will seek to avoid unnecessary fluctuations in output and demand.\" The projections in the March Inflation Report indicated that inflation will gradually decline in Norway. With approximately unchanged interest rates, consumer price inflation was projected at 2 per cent in 2003. The new mandate for monetary policy may, however, influence our projections via inflation expectations. The inflation target of 2½ per cent, which is higher than that of the ECB, may raise inflation expectations somewhat. On the other hand, the quantification of an inflation target may have a clarifying effect. The phasing in of petroleum revenues may, in isolation, imply a more expansionary fiscal stance than postulated earlier as a technical assumption in the March Inflation Report. However, the Government has also stated that fiscal policy shall be used to stabilise developments in the Norwegian economy. World economic growth is slowing and there is uncertainty attached to developments ahead. The Federal Reserve has reduced the target for the fed funds rate by a total of 1½ percentage points since the beginning of the year. The Japanese central bank has in practice reverted to a zero interest rate policy. Interest rates have also been lowered in several other countries. Capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy remains high. The labour market is tight. The supply of credit remains high and inflation is high. In February, the year-on-year rise in the consumer price index was 3.6 per cent. Excluding indirect taxes and changes in electricity and petrol prices, underlying inflation was 2.9 per cent. Measured by the import-weighted krone exchange rate, the krone has appreciated by 1.5 per cent compared with the assumption in the March Inflation Report. In isolation, this will have a dampening effect on externally generated inflation impulses. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in the interest rate will be a reduction is the same as the probability of an increase.     Norges Bank&#8217;s press conference of 21 February 2001 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 21 February. Norges Bank's key rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 7.00 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. Norges Bank does not have the instruments to fine-tune the exchange rate, but when setting interest rates the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability: price and cost inflation must be brought down towards the corresponding aim for inflation in the euro area. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank’s inflation reports, together with its continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide the basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank’s assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 21 December 2000. The projections in the December 2000 Inflation Report indicate that price and cost inflation in Norway will gradually slow. Given approximately unchanged interest rates, the projection for price inflation is a little less than 2 per cent from the end of 2002. The effective import-weighted krone exchange rate has shown little change since the previous monetary policy meeting, but is somewhat weaker than it was a year ago. Measured against the euro, the krone has remained virtually unchanged since the previous monetary policy meeting. World economic growth appears to be somewhat slower than assumed in the previous Inflation Report. Developments in the global economy are uncertain. The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate by a total of 1 percentage point in January. Key rates have also been lowered in other countries. New information since the December 2000 Inflation Report does not provide a basis for a substantial change in the assessment of developments in the Norwegian economy. Quarterly national accounts indicate somewhat lower growth in household demand than expected in the second half of 2000. On the other hand, capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy remains high. The labour market is tight. There appears to be somewhat greater optimism in the manufacturing sector. New information points to higher-than-expected petroleum investment. Price inflation is high. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index was 3.4 per cent in January. Underlying price inflation, i.e. price inflation excluding indirect taxes, electricity and petrol prices, was 2.8 per cent. House prices may have risen again in January after a decline towards the end of 2000. Credit supply remains high, although the growth rate slowed somewhat in December. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be a reduction is the same as the probability of an increase.     Norges Bank's press conference of 10 January 2001 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 10 January. Norges Bank's key rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 7.00 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. Norges Bank does not have the instruments to fine-tune the exchange rate, but when setting interest rates the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability: price and cost inflation must over time be brought down towards the corresponding aim for inflation for the European Central Bank (ECB). At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank's inflation reports, together with its continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide the basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank's assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 21 December 2000. In the December 2000 Inflation Report, consumer prices were projected to rise by 3 per cent in 2001 and 2½ per cent next year. Price inflation in the period 2003-2004 was projected at an average of 2¼ per cent. The inflation projections are based on the assumption that interest rates move in line with market expectations, as implied by forward rates on 14 December. The fall in forward rates was so pronounced that this influenced the inflation projections and the economic scenario presented in the report. Given an approximately unchanged interest rate, the inflation projection would be a little less than 2 per cent from the end of 2002. The effective import-weighted krone exchange rate, which is an indicator of international price impulses affecting the Norwegian economy, has appreciated somewhat since the last monetary policy meeting on 13 December 2000, but is almost 2 per cent weaker than it was at the beginning of 2000. The euro has appreciated considerably against the US dollar in recent weeks. The krone has depreciated against the euro since the December meeting and is almost 2 per cent weaker than at the beginning of 2000. The expected slowdown in world economic growth now appears to have commenced. Short-term statistics for the US now provide growing evidence of more moderate growth. In order to prevent the economy from slowing down too fast, the Federal Reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate by half a percentage point to 6 per cent on 3 January. The recent fall in oil prices will also contribute to reducing the risk of a sharp turnaround internationally. The situation in the Norwegian economy has not changed markedly since the December 2000 Inflation Report. Price inflation is high. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index was 3.0 per cent in December. The underlying rise in prices, ie excluding indirect taxes and changes in electricity prices and adjusted for the revision of the house rent index, stood at 2.8 per cent. On average, prices rose by 3.1 per cent from 1999 to 2000. The underlying rise in prices was 2.9 per cent. If changes in petrol prices are also excluded, price inflation was 2.4 per cent. The labour market remains tight. Credit growth is still high. House prices appear to be stabilising. Growth in goods consumption has moderated. Slower growth in the global economy may also contribute to reducing growth in the Norwegian economy. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be a reduction is the same as the probability of an increase.      Norges Bank's press conference of 11 December 2002 Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to reduce the key rate, the sight deposit rate, by 0.5 percentage point with effect from Thursday, 12 December 2002. The sight deposit rate will then be 6.5 per cent. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with an interest rate of 6.5 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The baseline scenario in the Inflation Report published on October 30 was based on the assumption of a krone exchange rate equal to the average for the previous three months. Inflation at the end of 2004 was projected at 2½ per cent. In the same report, analyses based on alternative exchange rate assumptions showed that with a 3 per cent appreciation of the krone, inflation two years ahead would fall to 2¼ per cent. In November and thus far in December, the krone has generally been 1½-2 per cent stronger than the exchange rate assumption in the baseline scenario. Price inflation has been approximately as expected. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, the year-on-year rise in consumer prices was 2.0 per cent in November 2002. The recovery in the international economy is weak and uneven. There is uncertainty as to when the expected rebound in investment will occur and concern about the possibility of war. The German economy is stagnating. Key rates have been reduced in the US, the euro area, Denmark and Sweden. The oil price is somewhat lower than assumed in the October Inflation Report but remains high. In Norway, there are also signs that developments may be somewhat weaker than expected. Manufacturing as well as households have become more pessimistic. A sharp increase in electricity prices will curb growth in household real income. Household borrowing is still high and the household debt burden continues to rise. Although growth in credit to households slowed somewhat from October 2001 to October 2002, double digit growth continues. The rise in house prices now appears to be tapering off. Rental prices for commercial property have fallen. Developments in the housing market and less optimism in the household sector may reduce credit growth in the future. The budget compromise of 22 November reallocated about NOK 4.4 billion. The structural, non-oil deficit in 2003 is thus the same as the Government's proposal in the National Budget for 2003. Underlying real growth in central government budget expenditure is still estimated at about ½ per cent. A corporate tax cut, which has been approved for the fiscal year 2003, will reduce government revenues the following year. Our regional network has reported that many enterprises are focused on reducing costs following this year's costly wage settlement. The strong krone will weaken profitability in the export industry. Many sectors are reporting reduced demand and declining profitability, although the picture is more positive for retail trade and some private service industries. Current statistics indicate some sluggishness in the labour market. Unemployment has risen in all counties and for most occupational groups. Unemployment is rising in particular in some service industries. At the moment, there is no sign of substantially higher unemployment in counties where manufacturing dominates. We have not yet seen the full effect of weak competitiveness on employment in industries and regions that are particularly exposed to international competition. Overall, these trends point to somewhat lower price inflation ahead. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with an interest rate of 6.5 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher.

Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 7 per cent. According to Norges Bank's overall assessment, with an unchanged interest rate ahead, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank's Inflation Report, together with the Bank's current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning the key interest rate. In the Inflation Report presented today, consumer price inflation two years ahead, with an unchanged interest rate, is projected at 2½ per cent. The risks to the projections are considered to be balanced. Inflation was somewhat higher than expected over the summer, but edged down in August and September. A strong krone and falling prices for imported consumer goods have pushed down consumer price inflation over the last two months in spite of sharp growth in labour costs in Norway. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, the year-on-year rise in consumer prices was 2.2 per cent in September. Developments in the global economy have been weak through the summer and autumn. Both in the US and Europe, economic growth has stagnated following strong growth at the beginning of the year. Equity prices have exhibited a sharp fall in the period to October. Growth in the world economy is still expected to pick up, but the strength of the recovery is now expected to be weaker than assumed earlier. Developments in investment could be decisive for how strong the recovery will be. Considerable idle capacity in several sectors suggests that it may take time for investment to show a pronounced rebound. The growth projections for the Norwegian economy have been revised downwards somewhat on the July Inflation Report, primarily as a result of the interest rate increase in July, weaker international developments and a stronger krone. Earnings at enterprises exposed to foreign or domestic competition may decline as a result of weaker competitiveness and sluggish growth in the world economy. On the other hand, oil prices are high. This is generating solid revenues for the petroleum sector and the state. The sharp rise in labour costs may also have an impact on the level of activity in enterprises that are normally sheltered from foreign competition, and in public enterprises. Employment growth may thus be moderate in the period ahead and unemployment may edge up. The government budget proposal for 2003 shows underlying expenditure growth of 4.5 per cent, with real spending growth estimated at 0.5 per cent. The effects of the budget proposal on aggregate demand are projected to be mildly positive. The forecasts for developments in the Government Petroleum Fund and for the use of petroleum revenues have been revised downwards appreciably for the years ahead. Norwegian households are generally optimistic about the outlook for their financial situation. They are borrowing heavily and house prices are high. Private consumption appears to be growing at a fast pace. The effective krone exchange rate is 2½ per cent stronger and the import-weighted krone exchange rate close to 4 per cent stronger than assumed in the July report. The appreciation of the krone will translate into a fall in imported goods over the next few years. This will offset the inflationary impulses from the strong growth in wages. Inflation will probably fall to less than 2 per cent next spring. As the effects of the appreciation of the krone gradually unwind, it is likely that the high level of wage growth will again start to dominate and inflation to rise. In the work on this Inflation Report we have used information from the regional network that we established this autumn. We will have six rounds of talks with business and community leaders about financial developments in their enterprises and industries, with around 200 visits in each round. We have divided the country into 7 regions, and in 6 we have established contacts with regional research institutes that are responsible for the contact meetings on behalf of Norges Bank. I would also like to mention that the Executive Board of Norges Bank has decided to release the strategy document that is prepared in connection with the work on the Inflation Report. The document discusses the consequences of the projections for interest-rate setting in the period ahead. The strategy document will be released four months after the document has been approved by the Executive Board.     Norges Bank's press conference of 18 September 2002 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 18 September. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 7 per cent. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with an unchanged interest rate, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. In Norges Bank's last Inflation Report of 3 July 2002, consumer price inflation two years ahead, assuming an unchanged interest rate of 6.5 per cent and a krone exchange rate unchanged from the average rate in the second quarter, was projected at 2¾ per cent. At the monetary policy meeting on the same day, the deposit rate was raised by 0.5 percentage point, to 7 per cent. Developments this summer indicate that the international recovery may be weaker, and come later, than we expected earlier. Equity prices have fallen markedly. Markets for Norway's export industries are stagnating, but at the same time the high oil price is providing a stimulus for some sectors of the Norwegian economy. Demand growth in Norway remains strong. Persistently high wage growth is contributing to a sharp rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services. Household income is growing strongly, and household borrowing is substantial. Measured by value, growth in retail sales is high. Labour market developments are approximately as expected. According to Statistics Norway's labour force survey, unemployment has remained at about 3¾ per cent. On the other hand, registered unemployment has risen somewhat. The Norwegian krone is strong. This summer the effective krone exchange rate has been 2-3 per cent higher than assumed in the July Inflation Report. Consumer prices increased somewhat more than expected in June and July, but returned to the expected level in August. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, consumer prices rose by 2.3 per cent compared with August 2001. A sharp rise in labour costs is contributing to a relatively high rise in prices for goods and services produced in Norway. A persistently strong krone will contribute to keeping down prices for imported goods. The strong krone will also have consequences for activity in the internationally exposed sector. Together with prospects for low inflation internationally, the strong krone is the most important force acting as a counterweight to the sharp rise in domestic costs.      Norges Bank's press conference of 7 August 2002 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 7 August. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 7 per cent. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with an unchanged interest rate, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be lower. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. In Norges Bank's last Inflation Report of 3 July, consumer price inflation two years ahead, with an unchanged interest rate of 6.5 per cent, was projected at 2¾ per cent. At the monetary policy meeting the same day, the Executive Board of Norges Bank decided to increase the key rate by 0.5 percentage point, to 7.0 per cent. There is uncertainty as to developments in many of the factors that will influence inflation in the period ahead. This includes the krone exchange rate. Relationships in foreign exchange markets are unstable. Our projections for inflation in the July Inflation Report were based on the assumption of a krone exchange rate equal to the average for the second quarter. The krone is now somewhat stronger than this. A persistently strong krone will dampen inflation. If the krone depreciates, for example, in line with developments in forward rates for the Norwegian krone, inflation may be higher than 2½ per cent. There has been some movement in foreign exchange markets since the monetary policy meeting in July. The krone exchange rate appreciated in the first weeks of July but has subsequently depreciated. Pricing in the currency options market shows that exchange market participants are considerably more uncertain about developments in the krone exchange rate than they were earlier this year. This reflects unrest and instability in the international foreign exchange, bond and equity markets in July. Equity prices have fallen sharply. The unrest originated in the US. The fall in equity prices was initially due to uncertainty about actual earnings in a number of large US companies and about companies' financial position. The decline in equity prices led to growing uncertainty about the prospects for growth in the global economy and this in turn has influenced equity prices. International financial unrest has also influenced developments on the Oslo Stock Exchange during the summer. The projections in the July Inflation Report were based on the assumption that a moderate upturn in the global economy would gradually take firmer root. Economic indicators since the last Inflation Report have been somewhat mixed. Consumer and business confidence indicators have been weak. Growth in the US was lower than expected in the second quarter. There is now considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy, but this does not appear to have affected the petroleum market. The oil price is high. Confidence in OPEC's ability to balance supply and demand in the oil market as well as the risk of war in the Middle East are influencing prices. In the Norwegian economy, domestic demand is expanding sharply. We expect a high level of housing investment and investment in the petroleum sector. Large projects in the aluminium industry are boosting mainland business investment, whereas other investment may be low. It is assumed that strong growth in household disposable income will contribute to solid growth in private consumption in the period ahead. Growth in domestic credit remains buoyant. Household borrowing is extensive. House prices are high. Developments in unemployment are in line with our projections in the July Inflation Report. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices, adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, was 2.7 per cent in June. Price inflation was somewhat higher than projected. Prices for domestically produced goods and services in particular rose more than expected. In the period ahead, strong wage growth will influence developments in prices for domestically produced goods and services.\r",
      "               Norges Bank's press conference of 3 July 2002 The Executive Board of Norges Bank has today decided to increase its key rate, the sight deposit rate, by 0.5 percentage point with effect from tomorrow, 4 July. The sight deposit rate will hence be 7.0 per cent. According to Norges Bank's overall assessment of the balance of risks, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be lower. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank's Inflation Report, together with the Bank's current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning the key rate. In the Inflation Report presented today, consumer price inflation two years ahead, with an unchanged interest rate of 6.5 per cent, is projected at 2¾ per cent. Developments in international financial markets are marked by uncertainty. As in the February Inflation Report, our projections are based on the assumption of a gradual rebound in activity among our trading partners. The upturn is expected to be moderate. Private consumption continued to expand in many countries even during the downturn. As a result, consumption growth is not expected to pick up to the same extent as has been customary during previous cyclical upturns. The oil price has remained firm, also measured in terms of the Norwegian krone. Growth in the Norwegian economy picked up towards the end of 2001 and into 2002. Private consumption has shown a substantial rise as a result of strong income growth. Households also expect continued strong income growth in the period ahead. Households are still borrowing heavily. Housing investment is high and financial investment is low. House prices are rising. Public expenditure is growing as a percentage of GDP. The level of petroleum investment is expected to be high. Large projects in the aluminium industry are boosting mainland business investment, whereas other investment may be low. There are strong pressures on economic resources. Wage growth is markedly higher than estimated in the February Inflation Report. The results of the various pay settlements point to wage growth of between 5½ per cent and 6 per cent this year. This year's wage settlements resulted in different pay increases for different groups and substantial pay increases that will take effect next year for some groups, even though wage increases are also to be negotiated in 2003. These developments may easily trigger and amplify wage-wage spirals. Persistently high wage growth is contributing to a high rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices, adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, was 2.6 per cent in May. The Norwegian krone has continued to appreciate. Expectations of higher interest rates as a result of developments in wage settlements have probably contributed to this. Another contributing factor is the weakening of the petroleum fund mechanism as a result of the state's domestic use of NOK 23 billion for the purchase of hospitals. There may also be other factors that have contributed to the appreciation of the krone. Some factors may be of a temporary nature. Developments in the krone exchange rate are discussed further in the Inflation Report. There is uncertainty as to developments in many of the factors that will influence inflation in the period ahead. This also applies to the krone exchange rate. Relationships in the foreign exchange market are unstable. Our projections for inflation are based on the assumption of a krone exchange rate equal to the average for the second quarter. The krone is now stronger than this. A persistently strong krone will have a dampening impact on inflation compared with the projections we have presented. In the report, we have also illustrated that inflation two years ahead may approach 3 per cent if the krone depreciates. A further analysis of the inflation outlook and an overview of important features of the Norwegian economy are provided in the accompanying charts.      Norges Bank's press conference of 22 May 2002 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 22 May. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 6.50 per cent. According to Norges Bank's overall assessment of the balance of risks, with an unchanged interest rate ahead, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be lower. The operational objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The Government has set the inflation target at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. In Norges Bank's last Inflation Report of 27 February, the rise in consumer prices two years ahead, with unchanged interest rates, was estimated at 2½ per cent. In the report we pointed to the uncertainty associated with global economic developments and indicated that import price inflation may pick up at a later stage than anticipated. At the same time, there was a risk that wage growth would be higher than projected. Overall, we considered both then and at the previous monetary policy meeting on 10 April that the risks to the inflation projection were balanced. Global economic growth is picking up, following sluggish developments through 2001. Growth in the US in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of this year was stronger than expected. Higher defence expenditure, reduced taxes and low interest rates have been contributing factors, but it is uncertain whether the recovery has taken hold. It appears that growth in the euro area will be moderate. The Japanese economy is still in a difficult situation, but the decline in industrial output appears to have come to a halt. A high oil price could dampen the global upturn and lead to higher inflation. Prices have risen more than expected in the euro area. On balance, it appears that growth among our trading partners will be somewhat stronger and price inflation somewhat higher than estimated in the February Inflation Report. The labour market in Norway is tight, with high wage growth. So far, those of this year's wage settlements that have been concluded since the last monetary policy meeting point to higher-than-projected wage growth. Different pay increases for different groups of employees may lay the basis for a new wage-wage spiral. The rise in wages is contributing to higher growth in household disposable income and to higher private consumption. Current statistics also point to strong consumption growth. House prices remain buoyant, and household borrowing is extensive. Petroleum sector income is high. Other sectors of the domestic economy have developed approximately as expected. In this year's Revised National Budget, the Government has adhered closely to the fiscal guideline. Consumer price inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products was 2.4 per cent in the twelve months to April this year. Price inflation is approximately as projected by Norges Bank. The krone exchange rate has continued to appreciate against other currencies. The effective krone exchange rate is now 4½ per cent stronger than the rate assumed in the February Inflation Report. In isolation this points to lower inflation. Nevertheless, according to Norges Bank's assessment of the risks associated with the inflation outlook, the appreciation of the krone cannot fully counteract stronger wage growth, faster growth in consumption, a higher oil price and a somewhat more favourable global economic outlook.     Norges Bank&#8217;s press conference of 10 April 2002 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 10 April. Norges Bank’s key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 6.50 per cent. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. In Norges Bank’s most recent Inflation Report published on 27 February, consumer price inflation two years ahead with unchanged interest rates was projected at 2½ per cent. In the report we pointed to the uncertainty associated with global economic developments and indicated that import price inflation may pick up at a later stage than previously anticipated. At the same time, there was a risk that wage growth would be higher than projected. Overall, the risks to the inflation projection were considered to be balanced. It now appears that economic growth in the US is picking up faster than assumed in the February Inflation Report. There are still few signs of stronger growth in Europe, but it is likely that growth will pick up as the recovery in the US takes hold. In Japan there is still little evidence of an imminent recovery. Oil prices have exhibited a marked rise. A persistently high oil price could fuel externally generated inflationary impulses to the Norwegian economy. On the other hand, higher oil prices may in isolation have a dampening impact on a global upturn. The krone exchange rate has continued to appreciate. The effective krone exchange rate is now 2 per cent stronger than assumed in the Inflation Report, which will in isolation exert downward pressure on inflation. The domestic economy has largely followed the path projected in the Inflation Report. Consumption indicators point to strong growth in private consumption. House prices are on the rise. Household borrowing is at a very high level. The labour market remains tight. Wage negotiations are under way, but at this stage it would be premature to draw any conclusions about the outcome. Consumer price inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products was 2.6 per cent in the twelve months to March this year. According to Norges Bank’s overall assessment of the balance of risks, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower. Pursuant to the mandate for monetary policy, Norges Bank shall regularly publish the assessments underlying the implementation of monetary policy. Norges Bank has presented its annual report for 2001 today. The report contains an overview of the implementation of monetary policy in 2001 and discusses monetary policy performance. The report also provides an overview of the Bank’s work in the field of financial stability and the central bank’s activities in general.      Norges Bank's press conference of 27 February 2002 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 27 February. Norges Bank’s key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 6.50 per cent. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank’s Inflation Report, together with the Bank’s current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for interest rate decisions. In the Inflation Report that is being presented today, the rise in consumer prices two years ahead, with unchanged interest rates, is estimated at 2½ per cent. Since the last monetary policy meeting on 23 January, the krone has appreciated. In isolation this points to lower inflation. On the other hand, retail sales have increased. Households are now more optimistic about the outlook for their own financial situation. House prices are still rising and household borrowing remains at a high level. The rise in unemployment towards the end of last year levelled off in January. In 2001, wage growth proved to be somewhat higher than expected. Oil prices have been fairly stable at around USD 20 per barrel. Tax changes have a significant impact on consumer price developments, and the consumer price index rose by only 1.3 per cent from January 2001 to January 2002. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, price inflation was 2.5 per cent. Since the last Inflation Report, which was published at the end of October, there have been some signs of an early recovery in the US economy. As in the last report, demand is expected to pick up through the year both in the US and Europe. The recession in Japan appears to be continuing. International producer prices have declined and consumer price inflation is falling. Our assessment of uncertainty has changed. The risk of a deep and prolonged recession is somewhat reduced, but there is still substantial uncertainty and it is too early to establish whether a renewed upswing has taken hold. As in the previous report, prices for imported goods are expected to fall this year. Recent developments in the krone exchange rate will also contribute to this. The increase in import prices is expected to pick up again through 2003. During the autumn of 2001, enterprises in some industries in Norway started to feel the effects of a fall in prices and lower demand in export markets. Nevertheless, it appears that the overall effects of the global downturn on the activity level in Norway have been limited. The projections for petroleum investment have also been revised upwards for the years ahead. Household income is expected to show strong growth this year, partly as a result of lower direct and indirect taxes. Our projection for domestic demand has therefore been revised upwards. The risks surrounding this projection are considered to be balanced. Annual wage growth is projected at 5 per cent in the period ahead. If profitability in the manufacturing sector is of less importance than earlier and wage-wage spirals in sheltered sectors of greater importance, the nominal rise in labour costs will be higher. According to Norges Bank’s overall assessment of the balance of risks, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower.     Norges Bank's press conference of 23 January 2002 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 23 January. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 6.50 per cent. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. Changes in the interest rate will normally be made gradually. The analyses in Norges Bank’s Inflation Reports, together with the Bank’s current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. In Norges Bank’s last Inflation Report, published on 31 October 2001, consumer price inflation two years ahead, with interest rates unchanged at 7 per cent, was estimated at 2½ per cent. The Inflation Report indicated that there was uncertainty surrounding the inflation projection. On the whole, the Bank’s assessment was that the probability that inflation two years ahead would be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it would be higher. At the last monetary policy meeting, the interest rate was reduced by 0.5 percentage point. Our assessment of the balance of risks was unchanged. The Norwegian krone has appreciated somewhat since the last monetary policy meeting. The price of oil has remained between USD 18 and USD 20 per barrel. The price of oil futures has remained stable at around USD 20 per barrel. Consumer prices rose somewhat more than expected in December. Adjusted for changes in real taxes and energy prices, consumer prices rose by 2.7 per cent in the twelve-month period to December. The risk of a deep recession in the world economy now appears to have diminished. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding both the timing and the scale of a recovery. Developments in Japan are highly uncertain. International producer prices have declined markedly. Foreign trade figures for the fourth quarter of 2001 indicate that the reduction in export volumes may have come to a halt, while export prices continue to fall. Consumption indicators suggest strong growth in private consumption. It appears that house prices will remain high. Credit growth is still high. Household borrowing has increased, while growth in enterprise borrowing has slowed. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate has revised upwards its projections of petroleum investment in the years ahead. Unemployment has risen somewhat, especially in the counties of Oslo and Akershus. According to Norges Bank’s assessment, with an unchanged interest rate ahead, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is still greater than the probability that it will be higher.     Press release Norges Bank reduces interest rates Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to reduce the interest rate on banks' deposits with Norges Bank, the sight deposit rate, by 0.25 percentage point to 2.25 per cent with effect from 18 December 2003. The interest rate on banks' overnight loans is being reduced correspondingly. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 2.25 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The Government has defined an inflation target for monetary policy in Norway. The operational objective is a rise in consumer prices of 2½ per cent over time. In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances are not taken into account. Norges Bank places particular emphasis on CPI inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) when assessing underlying inflation. Normally, Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to achieving an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead. It would in general have been possible to achieve the inflation target at a horizon shorter than two years by changing the interest rate more rapidly and more markedly. This might, however, have a greater impact on output and employment. Norges Bank has based its monetary policy on flexible inflation targeting, where variability in both output and inflation are given weight. At the meeting of the Executive Board of 29 October, the sight deposit rate was left unchanged, at 2.5 per cent. It was also stated that according to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 2.5 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead would be higher than 2½ per cent was the same as the probability that it would be lower. The press release following the meeting of 29 October stated that after a period of very low inflation as we have now witnessed, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant in monetary policy in the event that inflation does not increase as projected. In Inflation Report 3/03, Norges Bank projected that growth in mainland GDP would pick up from ¾ per cent this year to 3 per cent in 2004 and 2¾ per cent in 2005. The output gap, as calculated by Norges Bank, was expected to be marginally positive next year and in 2005 and 2006. This means that output in the mainland economy is expected to be slightly higher than the level indicated by trend growth. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was projected to increase to about 2¼ per cent next summer and to stabilise at target from autumn 2005. The analyses in the Inflation Report were based on a technical assumption that the interest rate would move in line with forward rates in the money market as observed on 23 October. This implied that the interest rate would remain approximately unchanged up to summer 2004 and thereafter increase gradually in step with foreign rates. Furthermore, the analyses were based on the assumption that the exchange rate would depreciate by close to 2 per cent over the next few years. This assumption was based on expectations in the foreign exchange market as reflected in the forward exchange rate for NOK on 23 October. The Executive Board has placed particular emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting: Inflation has been lower than expected. The year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE fell to 0.5 per cent in November. For example, prices for air travel, telecom services, beverages and imported goods such as footwear and audiovisual equipment showed a decline. The rise in prices for imported consumer goods was lower than expected in both October and November. Developments in prices for services with wages as a dominant cost factor and house rents have been broadly in line with expectations. The import-weighted krone exchange rate (I-44) has appreciated by about 1½ per cent since the last monetary policy meeting. Interest rate expectations in Norway and among trading partners are now about the same one year ahead. Economic growth in the US has been somewhat stronger than expected, while developments in Japan and the euro area appear to be approximately as projected. The rise in prices for Norwegian imported goods, measured in foreign currency, remains low. The Federal Reserve kept its key rate unchanged at 1 per cent at its meeting of 9 December, but stated that the \"probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. However, with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the [Federal Open Market] Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period\". The European Central Bank has kept its key rate unchanged at 2 per cent, while the central banks in the UK and Australia have raised their key rates. After recording a new peak in mid-November, oil prices have remained above USD 28 per barrel in recent weeks. Unrest in the Middle East and oil stocks in the US that are lower than normal for this time of year are holding up oil prices. Petroleum investment will be high in both 2004 and 2005. More petroleum industry contracts are being awarded to Norwegian enterprises. According to preliminary figures from Statistics Norway, mainland GDP growth was fairly high in the third quarter of 2003 and figures for the first half of the year have been revised upwards slightly. Employment increased again during the summer and autumn months. Unemployment has been approximately unchanged in recent months. House prices have risen since last summer, while there is still excess capacity in commercial property. Growth in credit to households has risen, while corporate demand for credit is still very low. Following the final budget bill for this year and the budget resolution for next year, it appears that fiscal policy is somewhat more expansionary. The effects on inflation ahead are considered to be small. Norges Bank's regional network reports that many enterprises have reduced their workforce and cut costs as planned. Household demand for retail goods and for services is rising. Growth in demand and output is more moderate in manufacturing and the corporate service sector, and enterprises are uncertain about the sustainability of the recovery. Profitability in the business sector is improving, also as a result of higher earnings. Even though they are cautious, the number of enterprises reporting specific plans for expanding their workforce has increased. Reports from the regional network do not point to any substantial increase in investment next year. The Executive Board has assessed the outlook and the following important risk factors: The depreciation of the krone in 2003 has not yet been reflected in consumer prices, but a higher rise in prices for imported consumer goods is expected to push up the rise in the consumer price index over the next six months. The decline in prices in November may be random and be reversed, but uncertainty as to when inflation will start to rise has increased. Krone exchange rate movements are also having a dampening effect on the inflation outlook. As discussed in Inflation Report 3/03, it may take longer for inflation to pick up if productivity growth is stronger than assumed by Norges Bank. Changes in the competitive situation in retail trade may influence productivity developments and prices to a greater extent than assumed earlier. The Inflation Report was based on the assumption that wage growth is primarily determined by overall conditions in the labour market. It is conceivable, however, that profitability in internationally exposed industries will play a more prominent role. Overall wage growth may then be lower than projected and lay the basis for an easing of monetary policy. Developments in recent months, however, may indicate that the labour market will stabilise more quickly than previously expected. Developments in European economies have a stronger impact on output and employment in Norway than developments in the US economy. Moderate growth in continental Europe is primarily being fuelled by higher net exports and is vulnerable to a strong euro. Against the background of the above factors, the Executive Board has made the following assessment: Inflation is lower than expected. The aim of monetary policy is higher inflation. After a period of very low inflation as we have now witnessed, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant in monetary policy when inflation does not increase as projected. The krone has appreciated after the last monetary policy meeting and has, in isolation, contributed to a tighter monetary policy stance. Output in the mainland economy has picked up during the autumn, and the outlook seems to be better than earlier. At the same time, the business sector is still feeling the effects of the very sharp rise in labour costs over several years. The cost level may hamper growth in output and employment. Total credit (domestic and foreign sources) has remained stable since last summer. Growth in credit to households has risen, while corporate demand for credit is still very low. Overall, the outlook for financial stability is considered to be satisfactory. The Executive Board has come to the conclusion that it is appropriate to reduce the key rate now. In reaching its decision, the Executive Board has weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations on the one hand against the risk that output growth may gradually become too strong on the other. However, we are taking a smaller step and are reducing the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.25 per cent. Furthermore, according to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 2.25 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. Charts - monetary policy meeting    Press release Norges Bank keeps interest rates unchanged Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 29 October 2003. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 2.5 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. Deputy Central Bank Governor Jarle Bergo states that according to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 2.5 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower. The Government has defined an inflation target for monetary policy in Norway. The operational objective is an inflation rate of 2½ per cent over time. In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances are not taken into account. Norges Bank places particular emphasis on CPI inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) when assessing underlying inflation. Normally, Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to achieving an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead. However, it would in general have been possible to attain the inflation target in the nearer term by changing the interest rate more rapidly and more markedly. Norges Bank has therefore chosen to operate a flexible inflation targeting regime where variability in both output and inflation are given weight. The choice of horizon is based on a perception of how interest rates influence the path of inflation and output, and the central bank's approach to striking a balance between the variability in these two variables. At its meeting of 17 September 2003, the Executive Board decided to reduce the key rate from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent. It was also stated that, according to Norges Bank's assessment, with an interest rate of 2.5 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead would be higher than the target was the same as the probability that it would be lower. The prospect of low inflation and low economic growth has led to a considerable easing of monetary policy since December 2002. In the current assessment of interest rates, the Executive Board has placed particular emphasis on the following factors: CPI inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) has slowed gradually since the summer of 2002. The year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 0.9 per cent in September. Inflation has been somewhat lower than we projected in the June Inflation Report. Low inflation abroad and the appreciation of the krone until January 2003 have resulted in declining prices for imported consumer goods, but these prices are now falling at a slower pace. The rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services has slowed in recent months. The interest rate reductions have narrowed the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries. As measured by the import-weighted index (I-44), the krone has depreciated by 9 per cent since the beginning of the year. Inflation is expected to move up as a result of the depreciation of the krone. A higher level of activity in the Norwegian economy will also gradually push up inflation. The easing of monetary policy will initially stimulate private consumption, which will lead to increased activity in industries that supply goods and services to households. A weaker krone will also contribute to higher exports. As international demand gradually picks up and excess capacity in service industries is reduced, demand for labour may rise in several sectors of the economy. Unemployment is projected to edge down again. Activity in the global economy has picked up from the low level prevailing last winter, primarily reflecting high growth in the US and some Asian countries, including Japan. In the euro area, developments have been considerably weaker, even though there are now signs that the trough has been reached. Growth among Norway's trading partners as a whole is expected to strengthen over the next two years. Oil prices have remained higher than USD 25 since the June Inflation Report and been about USD 30 in recent weeks. This reflects OPEC quota discipline, continued low oil stocks in the OECD area, particularly in the US, and lower-than-expected oil supply from Iraq. Petroleum investment is projected to increase markedly both this year and next. Even though imports will cover a high share of this investment, it will contribute to sustaining activity in manufacturing enterprises that supply goods and services to the petroleum sector. Looking further ahead, petroleum investment is expected to show a fairly pronounced decline. In the central government budget for 2004, the Government proposes a 5.4 per cent increase in public spending, which is somewhat higher than projected trend growth in the value of mainland GDP. The tax level remains unchanged in real terms. For 2003 and 2004 as a whole, fiscal policy will generate some stimulus to activity in the Norwegian economy. Norges Bank's regional network confirms that the fall in employment is moderating, but there are few businesses with plans to increase employment ahead. The regional network also reports that cost cuts in the business sector, particularly in service industries, are now yielding results in the form of improved profitability. The focus appears to have shifted to some extent from cost cuts to strategies for boosting revenues. The stimulus from monetary policy now appears to be feeding through, both via the reductions in the interest rate and a weaker krone. There are now emerging signs that activity in the Norwegian economy is picking up. However, it may take time for higher demand and production to have a substantial impact on employment and investment. The business sector is still feeling the effects of the sharp rise in labour costs over several years. At the same time, there is still excess capacity in a number of industries. A rise in demand can probably be accommodated to some extent using existing capacity. After a period, however, higher demand is likely to lead to renewed growth in employment and investment. Lower wage growth in the local government sector and other public entities will improve their financial position and gradually create scope for higher employment. All in all, mainland GDP is projected to expand by ¾ per cent in 2003. Growth was approximately zero in the first half of the year, but is projected to pick up in the second half. Mainland GDP growth is projected at 3 per cent in 2004 and 2¾ per cent in 2005. In 2006, mainland output is expected to increase just below trend growth, which we estimate at 2½ per cent. This path for overall production implies that the output gap, as estimated here, will be marginally positive next year and in 2005 and 2006. In the analysis in the Inflation Report, inflation returns to target in autumn 2005 and stabilises at this level. The Executive Board regards the following factors as particularly uncertain: Growth in credit to households, which has abated since spring 2002, may again accelerate. A renewed rise in house prices and the debt burden may lay the basis for new imbalances in the economy. Growth in credit to enterprises remains very low, however. This reflects imbalances between households' financial position and the financial position of some business sectors. The projections are based on the assumption that overall labour market conditions are the main determinant of wage growth. It is conceivable, however, that profitability in internationally exposed industries will again play a more prominent role in wage determination ahead than has been the case in recent years. In that case, overall wage growth might be lower than projected and lay the basis for an easing of monetary conditions. The global economy appears to be vulnerable to new disturbances. Since the summer, developments in international financial markets have reflected growing optimism concerning growth prospects. Equity prices and long-term interest rates have increased. However, the increase has been uneven and there have been wide fluctuations between major currencies. This may reflect uncertainty as to the resilience of the global economic recovery. The reduction in interest rates and the depreciation of the krone imply that inflation will gradually move up and be considerably higher as early as next spring. After a period of very low inflation as we have now witnessed, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant in monetary policy in the event that inflation does not increase as projected. Against the background of the Inflation Report, which is being published today, the Executive Board has made the following assessment: The aim of monetary policy in the period ahead is higher price inflation. The analysis in the Inflation Report indicates that inflation will move up and stabilise around the inflation target two years ahead. The real economy is projected to move on a balanced path. The analyses are based on the technical assumption that the interest rate moves in line with forward rates in the money market and that the krone depreciates. This implies that the interest rate will remain at approximately the current level in the first half of 2004 and then rise gradually in pace with interest rates abroad. The forward exchange rate implies a depreciation of the krone of close to 2 per cent from the average for the past three months. Such a path for the interest rate and the exchange rate may be consistent with the objective of monetary policy, and will probably contribute to keeping inflation expectations at around 2½ per cent. Economic developments have been broadly in line with the assumptions underlying the assessment at the last monetary policy meeting of 17 September. Monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. It will take time for all the effects of the pronounced shift in monetary policy since December 2002 to come into evidence. We have limited experience as to the effects of such a pronounced shift. Further interest rate changes are therefore not warranted at present. Charts - monetary policy meeting and press conference     Norges Bank's press conference of 17 September 2003 Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to reduce the key rate, the sight deposit rate, by 0.5 percentage point with effect from Thursday, 18 September. The sight deposit rate will then be 2.5 per cent. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with an interest rate of 2.50 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is the same as the probability that it will be lower. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank's Inflation Reports, together with the Bank's current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning the key interest rate. In its assessment today, the Executive Board placed particular emphasis on the following factors: The analyses in Norges Bank's June 2003 Inflation Report showed that a reduction in the sight deposit rate towards 3 per cent, combined with some depreciation of the krone, could bring inflation up towards the target two years ahead. The prospect of more moderate wage growth ahead could provide a basis for an even lower interest rate and weaker krone exchange rate without the inflation projections exceeding 2.5 per cent in the period. Underlying consumer price inflation is low, with a year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE of 0.9 per cent in August. The rise in prices for imported consumer goods is pushing down inflation. The rise in prices for domestically produced goods influenced by the global market has also slowed recently. The rise in prices for goods and services where wages are a dominant factor is being sustained. Developments in other countries indicate that prices, measured in the currencies of the producer countries, for imported goods and services will not rise appreciably. It appears that the economic recovery in the US and Japan may occur somewhat more swiftly and be more pronounced than projected in the Inflation Report. Growth in a number of Asian countries has picked up rapidly again following a slowdown this winter as a result of SARS and the war in Iraq. Europe, on the other hand, is still marked by stagnation, and growth this year may be slightly lower than projected in the Inflation Report. Strong productivity growth in the US economy enables companies to satisfy increased demand without increasing the workforce. The recovery in the US has not led to higher employment, adding some uncertainty concerning the strength and duration of the upturn. High household borrowing and increasing government deficits are having the same effect. Following the meetings of the Open Market Committee in August and September, the Federal Reserve stated that there is a risk of a further and undesirable fall in inflation. There are therefore prospects that short-term interest rates in the US will be low for a period ahead. Interest rates in other countries are also likely to remain low. In spite of sluggish global economic developments, oil prices have remained high. Low production levels in Iraq have contributed to buoying up oil prices. Strikes and production problems in Venezuela and Nigeria have also played a role. These factors, combined with a need to increase commercial stocks, may result in continued high oil prices. Capacity utilisation in Norway has declined from a high level and is now on a par with the level in the years 1995-1997, before cost inflation accelerated. Economic growth came to a halt last winter. There are signs that the easing of monetary policy is beginning to have an impact. The krone has depreciated slightly since the August 2003 monetary policy meeting, and is about 11 per cent weaker than at the beginning of 2003. The depreciation of the krone is contributing to stabilising inflation and activity in the economy. The quarterly national accounts for the second quarter of 2003 showed that the mainland economy grew slightly. Growth in goods consumption has increased, as expected. Households are now more optimistic about the economic outlook. Household debt is still increasing at a high rate, but growth has slowed since the spring. House prices have stabilised after falling slightly in the first half of 2003. Housing turnover is high. The rise in equity prices since the beginning of 2003 may reflect improved corporate profitability and increased optimism regarding the outlook ahead. According to Norges Bank's regional network, activity in retail trade and services for households has increased since the spring. Both the domestic and export market for manufacturing have improved slightly. Activity in industries providing services for the enterprise sector remains low. A number of enterprises in the regional network report plans for investments that will contribute to rationalisation. The low pay increases in this year's wage settlement may indicate that the social partners are placing increased emphasis on the effects of pay increases on future developments in interest rates, the krone exchange rate and employment. In the light of experience from 2002, it must be assumed that government agencies will be more cautious in future wage settlements. The labour market outlook underpins expectations of moderate wage growth. Improved profitability and a weaker krone are enhancing the competitiveness of internationally exposed enterprises, but competitiveness is substantially weaker than in the 1990s. Business sector investment is influenced by the high number of vacant business premises, and business sector demand for loans is stagnating. Surveys conducted by TNS Gallup indicate that economic agents expect low wage and price inflation for a period ahead. Inflation of approximately 2½ per cent is expected in the longer term. Nor do bond yields provide any indication that inflation expectations will deviate from the target for inflation over time. It has been appropriate to cut interest rates markedly this year because growth in the Norwegian economy is low. Interest rate reductions have been important in preventing inflation expectations from taking hold at too low a level. Developments in the Norwegian economy in recent months have been approximately as projected in the June 2003 Inflation Report. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 2.5 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be higher than 2½ per cent is now the same as the probability that it will be lower. Charts used in connection with the Executive Board's monetary policy meeting: International economy (201 kB) Financial markets (323 kB) Demand and output (78 kB) The labour market (69 kB) Prices (78 kB)     Norges Bank's press conference of 13 August 2003 Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to reduce the key rate, the sight deposit rate, by 1.0 percentage point with effect from Thursday, 14 August. The sight deposit rate will then be 3.0 per cent. According to Norges Bank's overall assessment, with an interest rate of 3.0 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank's Inflation Report, together with the Bank's current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning the key interest rate. In its assessment today, the Executive Board placed particular emphasis on the following factors: In the June Inflation Report, the underlying rise in prices was projected at a good 2 per cent two years ahead with a sight deposit rate of 4 per cent and a krone exchange rate equal to the average for the period 3-19 June. The Report also indicated that a reduction in the sight deposit rate towards 3 per cent, combined with some depreciation of the krone, could bring the rise in prices up to the inflation target two years ahead. If the easing of monetary policy and employment growth do not translate into higher wage growth, inflation could even with this path for interest rates and the krone remain lower than the target two years ahead. Without a considerable easing of monetary policy, inflation might be too low for an extensive period. Since the previous monetary policy meeting on 25 June, the underlying rise in prices has continued to fall. In July, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 0.7 per cent, which is lower than projected in the June Inflation Report and markedly lower than the inflation target. There are also prospects that inflation may be low for some time ahead. The fall in inflation primarily reflects a marked decline in prices for imported consumer goods. In addition, the rise in prices for domestically produced consumer goods influenced by world market prices is slowing. Growth in the international economy will be sluggish in 2003, particularly in the euro area. Labour market developments are generally weak. Price and cost inflation is low among our trading partners, and is expected to remain subdued. Oil prices are hovering around USD 30 per barrel. Low stocks in the US, uncertainty as to developments in Iraq and high demand as a result of closures of nuclear power plants in Japan are holding up oil prices. Since the end of June, key rates have been lowered by 0.25 percentage point in the US, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and Sweden. Expectations as to global economic developments in 2004 have recently improved somewhat. This applies in particular to financial markets and some confidence indicators. International equity prices have advanced over the past six months. Interest rates abroad are now expected to rise somewhat next year. In the US, there are now somewhat clearer signs of the expected upswing. GDP grew by 2.4 per cent (seasonally adjusted, annual rate) in the second quarter. According to euro area indicators, businesses and households expect activity to stabilise at a low level. Current indicators do not point to a stronger international upswing than that projected in the Inflation Report. This is reflected in key rates abroad which, even though they are expected to edge up, will remain at a historically low level for a long period ahead. In Norway, capacity utilisation has fallen from a very high level, and is now on a par with the level in the years 1995-1997 before cost inflation accelerated. Growth in the economy has come to a halt. Employment fell in the second quarter, and according to LFS figures the number of job-seekers has increased. Registered unemployment has edged down, but the number participating in labour market programmes has risen. Developments in manufacturing output are weak. Credit growth is slowing somewhat, but is still at a high level for households. Corporate borrowing is markedly lower. The number of bankruptcies is high. At the same time, there are also signs that the monetary policy easing and expectations of further monetary policy easing are now having an impact. The krone is about 5-6 per cent weaker than before Norges Bank signalled the possibility of larger steps in interest rate adjustments at the beginning of June, and about 2 per cent weaker than the assumption in the constant interest rate/exchange rate scenario in the Inflation Report. Growth in goods consumption picked up in June. House prices have shown a small rise after stagnating earlier this year. Statistics Norway's business tendency survey for the second quarter indicates that short-term expectations have improved somewhat. At the same time, however, the commercial property market is weak. Vacancy rates for commercial premises are high and rents have fallen. This will have an impact on investment in the period ahead. Activity in many public entities still appears to be affected by the time it takes to cover the expensive income settlements last year and in previous years. Developments in the Norwegian and international economy since the previous monetary policy meeting have been approximately in line with the projections in the Inflation Report, but consumer price inflation has been lower than projected. There are prospects that the underlying rise in prices in Norway will remain very low for a period ahead. At the same time, inflation is low in other countries. In a situation where there is a risk that inflation expectations take hold at a level that is too low, it will be appropriate to take larger steps in interest rate adjustments than that which is customary. The spring wage settlement and information on local wage developments so far this year would indicate a more moderate wage settlement ahead than in the years between 1998 and 2002. These prospects strengthen the basis for the larger steps in interest rate adjustments. According to Norges Bank's assessment, even with an interest rate of 3.0 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. Charts used in connection with the Executive Board's monetary policy meeting: International economy (209 kB) Financial markets (299 kB) Demand and output (105 kB) The labour market (72 kB) Prices (75 kB)     Norges Bank's press conference of 25 June 2003 Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to reduce the key rate, the sight deposit rate, by 1.0 percentage point with effect from Thursday, 26 June. The sight deposit rate will then be 4.0 per cent. According to Norges Bank's overall assessment, with an interest rate of 4.0 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank's Inflation Report, together with the Bank's current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning the key interest rate. In its assessment today, the Executive Board placed particular emphasis on the following factors: The year-on-year rise in consumer prices, as measured by the CPI-ATE, was 1.2 per cent in May 2003, which is lower than the projection in Norges Bank's March Inflation Report and considerably lower than the inflation target. There are also prospects that underlying inflation will be low in the period ahead. The fall in inflation primarily reflects a pronounced decline in prices for imported consumer goods. So far, oil prices have remained relatively high during the global downturn. To some extent this is insulating the Norwegian business sector. Global developments are nevertheless influencing the Norwegian economy. The outlook for the global economy is still weak. War, terrorism and the spread of disease have given rise to uncertainty. Substantial spare capacity in the business sector is restraining investment. Growth is low, particularly in Continental Europe, where the fiscal margin of manoeuvre is constrained by high public debt. Inflation is expected to be low among our trading partners and there is growing focus on the risk of deflation in some countries. Key rates have been lowered and there are expectations of further reductions. At the same time, short-term interest rates are expected to remain low for some time ahead, and bond yields are at a historic low. Fiscal policy is expansionary in the US, and a weaker dollar is having a favourable impact on the business sector. Equity prices advanced in the second quarter of this year, but there is no clear evidence that this signals a rapid turnaround in the world economy. Economic policy stimulus is expected to contribute to a gradual improvement in global growth. The situation in the Norwegian economy has changed over the past year. Capacity utilisation in the mainland economy, which was very high, has fallen and is now in line with that prevailing in 1995-1997 before costs started to rise. Growth in the economy has come to a halt. Even though the krone has depreciated this year, manufacturing sector competitiveness remains fairly weak. Employment in Norway has declined and unemployment has increased. Enterprises are rationalising in many service industries. Public entities have had limited scope for increasing service production because wages have risen. Fiscal policy is having a more neutral impact on total demand. A favourable aspect is that wage growth has moderated. Strong growth in household income last year and the decline in interest rates are sustaining growth in private consumption. Information from our regional network indicates that economic growth is weak in many business sectors. However, exports are no longer falling. The weakening of the krone has improved earnings in many enterprises. Monetary policy easing has in some previous cases had a considerable impact on demand and output, and on inflation. Even though the effects of monetary policy occur with a lag, the initial effects have come into evidence quickly. This has not occurred in 2003. Households and the business sector are still predominantly pessimistic. House prices have levelled off and are declining and credit demand is slowing. The krone fell markedly in the first quarter of 2003, but appreciated from March to end-May in spite of the prospect of additional interest rate reductions. This is partly because other countries have also reduced their interest rates. In June, however, the krone again depreciated. In the Inflation Report presented today, Norges Bank provides an assessment of the outlook for the Norwegian economy. With an unchanged sight deposit rate of 4 per cent and an exchange rate at around the current level, underlying inflation is projected to remain lower than the inflation target over the next two years. The interest rate reductions of a total of 3 percentage points since December last year are expected to result in fairly high growth in private consumption. Business investment will start to pick up again. With an unchanged monetary stance, economic growth will still be so low that production capacity will not be fully utilised in the years ahead. Even though inflation has been low in recent months, indicators suggest that inflation expectations are fairly stable at around 2½%. The fall in international inflation, as well as continued low inflation in Norway, may reduce expectations. The outlook for the Norwegian and global economy therefore implies that the period of monetary policy easing will continue. Norges Bank is now taking larger steps in interest rate adjustments. In money and foreign exchange markets, there are expectations of a relaxation of monetary policy both through lower interest rates and a weaker krone. Expectations imply that the sight deposit rate will be lowered towards 3 per cent by the end of this year, and that the krone will gradually fall in value by about 3 per cent in the period to end-2005. Lower unemployment may then lead to a renewed increase in wage growth. Against this background, underlying inflation may be close to target two years ahead. If the easing of monetary policy and employment growth do not translate into higher wage growth, inflation may, even with this path for the interest rate and the exchange rate, remain below target two years ahead. Given this outlook, there may also be a basis for an easing of monetary policy further than currently implied by expectations in money and foreign exchange markets. Charts used in connection with the Executive Board's monetary policy meeting: International economy (197 kB) Financial markets (296 kB) Demand and output (82 kB) The labour market (66 kB) Prices (124 kB)     Norges Bank's press conference of 30 April 2003 Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to reduce the key rate, the sight deposit rate, by 0.5 percentage point with effect from Thursday, 1 May. The sight deposit rate will then be 5.0 per cent. According to Norges Bank's overall assessment, with an interest rate of 5.0 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank's Inflation Report, together with the Bank's current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning the key interest rate. In its assessment today, the Executive Board placed particular emphasis on the following factors: In the Inflation Report published on 5 March, consumer price inflation two years head was projected at 2¼ per cent with an interest rate of 5½ per cent and a krone exchange rate equal to the average for February. Price inflation is expected to be subdued in the next few months due to the strong krone and low price inflation internationally. Price inflation in the first quarter was on average approximately as projected in the Inflation Report, while the March figure was somewhat lower than expected. In March, the year-on-year rise in consumer prices, as measured by the CPI-ATE, was 1.5 per cent. The strong krone last year and low inflation abroad contribute to a reduction in prices for imported consumer goods. The effective krone exchange rate has weakened this year and is now 2-3 per cent lower than assumed in the baseline scenario in the last Inflation Report. The rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services is marked by high wage growth in Norway. Wage growth in 2003 will be lower than in 2002. The results so far in this year's wage settlement indicate that wage growth in 2003 may also be somewhat lower than the projection in the Inflation Report, which was 5 per cent. Economic developments in the global economy are weak. Low interest rates and tax cuts are measures being used in a number of countries to sustain activity. It is uncertain when economic growth will become self-driven. In the US, there is a risk that growth in consumption will slow before investment picks up. Growth in Continental Europe has been sluggish, particularly as a result of developments in Germany. Since our last monetary policy meeting, the key rate has been reduced in the euro area, Sweden, Denmark and New Zealand, whereas it has been increased in Canada. In a number of countries, there are expectations of even lower interest rates. After the fall of the former regime in Iraq, equity prices have risen somewhat. The oil price has dropped to USD 23 per barrel. Growth in the Norwegian economy is probably also low. Developments in parts of the business sector are marked by high cost levels, low profitability and global stagnation. Investment may be lower than projected in the Inflation Report. High wage growth has weakened central and local government finances and will probably lead to stagnation in public sector employment. Unemployment is increasing. According to Statistics Norway's Labour Force Survey figures, unemployment has reached 4.1 per cent, which is on a par with the average for the 1990s. Growth in private consumption, which has been high, appears to be dampened somewhat by the high electricity bills that are now falling due for payment. Information from our regional network confirms a relatively sluggish trend. Demand and output in export-oriented manufacturing are falling, but the outlook is not perceived to be as negative as in the last contact round. The construction industry in southern Norway reports a low volume of new orders. Companies supplying services to the business sector are experiencing a period of strong contraction, and the production of services for households is stagnating. The consumer goods industry and retail trade continue to grow according to our network contacts. Credit growth is slowing. This is reflected particularly in lower credit demand from enterprises. House prices are levelling off. Normally, this would gradually lead to a decline in household credit demand, but growth in household debt is still very high. On balance, developments during the last few weeks point to low inflation in the period ahead. According to Norges Bank's overall assessment, with an interest rate of 5.0 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. Charts used in connection with the Executive Board's monetary policy meeting: International economy (177 kB) Financial markets (284 kB) Demand and output (75 kB) The labour market (76 kB) Prices (70 kB)     Norges Bank's press conference of 5 March 2003 Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to reduce the key rate, the sight deposit rate, by 0.5 percentage point with effect from Thursday, 6 March. The sight deposit rate will then be 5.5 per cent. According to Norges Bank's overall assessment, with an unchanged interest rate ahead, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The analyses in Norges Bank's Inflation Report, together with the Bank's current assessment of the outlook for price and cost inflation and developments in the money market and foreign exchange market, provide a basis for decisions concerning the key interest rate. In its assessment today, the Executive Board placed particular emphasis on the following factors: Inflation, as measured by the CPI-ATE, was 2.3 per cent in 2002. In recent months, inflation has been lower. The year-on-year rise was 1.8 per cent in January. Inflation is expected to be low in the period to the summer. Subsequently, inflation will depend on developments in wages, the exchange rate and the interest rate. The strong krone is the main factor behind low price inflation. The rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services is marked by the considerably higher level of wage growth in Norway relative to trading partners. As a result of higher electricity prices, the overall rise in prices was particularly high in January. This is a temporary effect that does not have a direct bearing on the interest rate. The world economy is in the doldrums. There are fears of recession in major economies such as the US, Germany and France. The outlook for the Japanese economy is weak. We still expect global growth to pick up gradually towards a more normal level, but the upturn may come at a later stage than previously assumed. The situation is highly uncertain, and we cannot rule out that the world economy is headed for a fairly long period of stagnation. Stagnation in the world economy will also contribute to lower growth in the Norwegian economy. Owing to fears of war and low oil reserves, particularly in the US, oil prices are hovering above USD 30 per barrel. Moreover, there is little idle capacity in several important OPEC countries. In the short term, this will hold up oil prices, but developments in the world economy may lead to a subsequent fall in prices. The Inflation Report published today presents two alternative paths for the Norwegian economy. In the baseline scenario, where the interest rate is held constant at 5½ per cent and the krone exchange rate at the average for the past month, inflation is projected to remain below 2½ per cent over the forecast horizon. In an alternative scenario, where monetary policy is eased in line with market expectations, inflation may be somewhat higher than target at the two-year horizon. There is uncertainty associated with developments in many of the factors that will influence inflation ahead, among others the exchange rate. This implies a gradual approach in the conduct of monetary policy. Unemployment has edged up in recent months. There is growing pessimism in manufacturing industry. In spite of the recent depreciation of the krone, profitability remains weak. The full effects of the high cost level have still not come into evidence in the business sector. Since decisions have already been made to close down or relocate some businesses, private sector employment will show a further decline. High wage growth has also reduced demand for labour in the public sector. Our regional network reports that problems in export-oriented industries are spreading to enterprises that supply goods to the domestic market. Many companies are seeking to sustain profitability by cutting costs, e.g. by reducing their workforces. Reports from the health sector and local government sector point to stagnating or falling employment. On the other hand, employment in retail trade and other sectors that sell services to households is stable or showing moderate growth. The high level of wage growth is, in isolation, holding up inflation in Norway. Annual wage growth will remain high this year because of the pay increases that have already been awarded. The projections for wage growth have been revised downwards in both scenarios in the Inflation Report, partly reflecting a weaker economic outlook. Household income growth is expected to slow this year and next as a result of weak employment developments and lower wage growth. The sharp rise in electricity prices has reduced real disposable income. Increased uncertainty in the labour market will make households more cautious. The interest rate reductions this winter will stimulate household demand in the period ahead and curb the negative effects of higher electricity prices and increased uncertainty. Private consumption may, nevertheless, show weaker growth this year than projected earlier. On balance, these developments point to low inflation in the period ahead. Norges Bank judges that, with an interest rate of 5.5 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. I would also like to draw your attention to some new features in this issue, and subsequent issues, of the Inflation Report. The Report has been expanded to include a summary and a more extensive presentation of monetary policy. The Strategy Document for the period November 2002 to March 2003 is included in a separate annex. In addition, the Report includes a summary of the reports from our regional network. Charts used in connection with the Executive Board's monetary policy meeting: The global economy (182 kB) Financial markets (295 kB) Demand and output (94 kB) The labour market (94 kB) Prices (103 kB)     Norges Bank's press conference of 22 January 2003 Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to reduce the key rate, the sight deposit rate, by 0.5 percentage point with effect from Thursday, 23 January. The sight deposit rate will then be 6.0 per cent. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with an interest rate of 6.0 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation. The inflation target is set at 2½ per cent. The key interest rate is set on the basis of an overall assessment of the inflation outlook, normally two years ahead. The baseline scenario in the Inflation Report published on 30 October was based on the assumption of a krone exchange rate equal to the average for the previous three months. Inflation at the end of 2004 was projected at 2½ per cent. In the same report, analyses based on alternative exchange rate assumptions showed that with a 3 per cent appreciation of the krone, inflation two years ahead would fall to 2¼ per cent. Since the publication of the Inflation Report, the krone has appreciated and is 3 per cent stronger than assumed in the baseline scenario. The strong krone is related to a considerably higher interest rate in Norway than in most other countries. This in turn is due to the relatively high level of wage and cost inflation in Norway, which reflects Norway's divergence from international cyclical developments. Fears of war in Iraq and high oil prices may have increased the flow of short-term capital into Norway and contributed to the appreciation of the krone. Fear of war, low production in Iraq and the loss of production in Venezuela have contributed to an increase in the price of oil to over USD 30 per barrel. Oil stocks in the US and other OECD countries are now low. Capacity utilisation in Saudi Arabia's oil production is fairly high. In the short term, this will keep the oil price at a high level, but developments may also lay the basis for a subsequent fall and wide fluctuations in the oil price. The recovery in the international economy is sluggish and uneven. Very low interest rates and tax cuts in the US and other countries are stimulating activity. It is still uncertain when global growth will pick up and become self-driven. The effects of the sharp fall in equity prices and earlier over-investment in several sectors have probably not yet been exhausted. Consumer price inflation rose markedly from November to December. This reflects higher electricity prices. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, the year-on-year rise in consumer prices was 1.8 per cent in December 2002. This was broadly in line with expectations. The increase in the price of electricity will lead to a sharp rise in the consumer price index over the next few months, but this is a short-term effect that does not directly influence the interest rate. Household borrowing is still high and the household debt burden continues to rise. Although growth in credit to households slowed somewhat from November 2001 to November 2002, double digit growth continues. The rise in house prices now appears to be slowing. Developments in the housing market and reduced optimism in the household sector may result in slower credit growth in the future. Developments in the retail sales index up to November last year indicate solid growth in private consumption. The increase in the price of electricity will reduce growth in household real disposable income this year. Growth in private consumption this year may therefore be lower than projected in the October Inflation Report. Higher electricity expenses for enterprises and households will largely be offset by higher income for other Norwegian sectors, and will therefore probably only have a limited impact on domestic demand in the next two to three years. Labour market developments have been broadly in line with expectations since the previous Inflation Report. We have not yet seen the full effect of high wage growth and the strong krone on employment in enterprises that are particularly exposed to international competition. Overall, these trends point to somewhat lower price inflation ahead. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with an interest rate of 6.0 per cent, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. Charts used in connection with the Executive Board's monetary policy meeting: The global economy (203 kB) Financial markets (299 kB) Demand and production (72 kB) The labour market (72 kB) Prices (76 kB)    Press release Norges Bank keeps the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave the interest rate unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 1.75 per cent. At this meeting, the Executive Board did not see any clear alternatives to leaving the interest rate unchanged. In reaching its decision, the Executive Board weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and of stable inflation expectations against the risk that output growth may eventually be too high. The objective of monetary policy is consumer price inflation of close to 2½ per cent over time. In the conduct of monetary policy, emphasis is also placed on stabilising output. Inflation has picked up recently in line with the projections in the November Inflation Report, but is still considerably below target. The key rate is therefore low. The unusually low interest rate implies, on the one hand, that we should exercise caution with regard to further interest rate reductions. On the other hand, the prospect of continued low inflation for a period ahead implies that wide deviations from projected economic developments would be required before interest rates should be increased. On balance, the outlook for inflation and the real economy in Norway is broadly in line with the projections in the November Inflation Report. The prospect of continued low inflation in Norway also implies that we should lag behind other countries in setting interest rates at a more normal level. Outlook and risk factorsSince the presentation of Norges Bank's last Inflation Report on 3 November, aggregate demand and output in Norway have developed broadly in line with expectations. Economic developments in Europe and Japan, however, have been weaker than projected. The Norwegian economy is showing solid growth, and there are prospects that growth will remain firm next year, as projected in the Inflation Report. Overall capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is increasing. \r",
      " New information concerning price developments suggests that the rate of inflation is picking up approximately in line with the projections in the Inflation Report. The Executive Board would place particular emphasis on the following factors:  Developments in consumer prices are, in isolation, reducing the risk that inflation will linger at a very low level. Underlying consumer price inflation, however, is still considerably below the inflation target. At the same time, in the period since the November Inflation Report, the krone exchange rate has generally been somewhat stronger than assumed in the report. A strong krone exchange rate may curb inflation ahead. The krone exchange rate has, however, now reverted to the level prevailing at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. Changes in the krone exchange rate must be viewed in the light of wide fluctuations in international foreign exchange markets and considerable variations in the oil price in recent weeks. Uncertainty with regard to the international recovery may have increased somewhat. The depreciation of the US dollar may further dampen the upturn in the euro area and in Japan. Economic developmentsThe Executive Board has also placed particular emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 3 November: \r",
      " Economic growth slowed in the euro area and in the UK in the third quarter, and has come to a halt in Japan in the past two quarters. In the US, economic growth is continuing, with a moderate upswing in employment. Expectations of a gradual interest rate increase in the euro area have ebbed, while interest rate expectations in the US have shifted slightly upwards. The rate of increase in consumer prices and producer prices has moved up in several countries, partly reflecting high oil prices. However, underlying inflation in the euro area and the US remains just below 2 per cent. Inflation expectations, as derived from inflation-linked bonds, are approximately unchanged both in the US and the euro area. There have been large fluctuations in exchange rates. The effective exchange rate for the US dollar has depreciated by about 2½ per cent since the beginning of November, while the value of euro has increased by 1¾ per cent. Oil prices have shown considerable fluctuations. Primarily as a result of a larger-than-expected increase in oil stocks in the US, spot prices in the oil market fell markedly in December to about USD 37 per barrel, which is about 20 per cent lower than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. In euro and Norwegian krone terms, oil prices have declined by almost 25 per cent in the same period. Oil futures prices have been more stable. In Norway, inflation has been very low since the beginning of 2004 and through the summer. Inflation edged up in autumn and in November the year-on-year rise in prices, as measured by the CPI-ATE, was 1.0 per cent. The fall in prices for imported goods has slowed markedly, and the rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services has picked up somewhat. Excluding the direct interest rate effect on house rents and changes in day-care rates, underlying inflation can be estimated at 1¼ per cent in November. According to surveys conducted by TNS Gallup, inflation expectations 2 and 5 years ahead were approximately unchanged between the third and fourth quarter of this year. The krone exchange rate, as measured by the I-44, has varied, but has been somewhat stronger than assumed in the November Inflation Report. The exchange rate is now close to the level prevailing directly prior to the previous monetary policy meeting. Financial market participants in Norway still expect a stable interest rate level through the first half of 2005. The interest rate differential against other countries is expected to remain negative in the period to autumn 2006. The goods consumption index has varied more than normally and fell in October. Retail sales statistics, based on VAT payments, show somewhat stronger consumer demand for goods than indicated by the goods consumption index. These statistics only apply up to June. TNS Gallup's expectations indicator for Norwegian households remained at a high level in the fourth quarter, and household credit demand is still exhibiting strong growth. New car registrations picked up markedly in November. Norges Bank's financial market statistics indicate that the fall in household net lending in the first six months of the year continued in the third quarter. This suggests that household demand for goods and services is still rising at a brisk pace. Production and capacity utilisation in manufacturing are picking up. Statistics Norway's fourth-quarter investment intentions survey for manufacturing shows that manufacturing investment will increase this year, but decline next year. Major projects in the oil refinery and chemical industries are the main factors behind the increase this year. Investment in the oil and gas sector is expected to pick up further in 2005. Investment is rising in service industries. Commercial building starts picked up further in September, particularly in distributive trades. Credit demand in the enterprise sector has also increased somewhat this autumn. Both traditional merchandise exports and imports are still expanding, but at a somewhat slower pace than through the summer. The slowdown is somewhat more pronounced for imports than for exports. According to preliminary figures from Statistics Norway, mainland production increased by 3.5 per cent between the third quarter of 2003 and the third quarter of 2004, primarily as a result of growth in manufacturing and service industries. Employment is still exhibiting moderate growth, and unemployment is showing a slight decline. The central government budget deficit for 2004 is now higher than previously assumed, primarily due to a shortfall in tax revenues. In the approved budget, central government expenditure growth is estimated at about 11 per cent in 2004 and 2005, which is somewhat higher than the growth estimate for mainland GDP in value terms. The rise in house prices has remained high in recent months. According to statistics from the Norwegian Association of Real Estate Agents, house prices rose by 11.5 per cent in the 12 months to November. Housing starts have edged down, but are still at a relatively high level. Information from Norges Bank's regional network indicates continued solid growth in output and demand for all industries. However, growth has slowed somewhat for the export industry and distributive trades in the latter half of the year. Enterprises still express a cautious attitude to new recruitment. Employment is increasing somewhat in the building and construction industry, distributive trades and other services. Enterprises are expecting a moderate increase in investment. For manufacturing, the main picture is that investment is still geared towards enhancing production efficiency, but many enterprises are now also planning to increase capacity. A larger number of enterprises than earlier are reporting that they are increasing prices. Previous assessmentsAt its previous monetary policy meeting on 3 November 2004, the Executive Board decided to keep Norges Bank's key rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent. At that meeting, the Executive Board did not see any clear alternatives to leaving the interest rate unchanged. \r",
      " The Executive Board's assessment was that the economic projections in the November Inflation Report imply a sight deposit rate in the interval 1¼ - 2¼ per cent in mid-March 2005: \"Uncertainty as to the effects of previous monetary policy easing and the unusually low interest rate level imply, on the one hand, that we should exercise caution with regard to further interest rate reductions. On the other hand, the prospect of continued low inflation for a period ahead implies that wide deviations from projected economic developments would be required before interest rates should be increased. The prospect of continued low inflation in Norway also implies that we should lag behind other countries in setting interest rates at a more normal level.\"  Charts - monetary policy meeting (959 kB)(Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting (183 kB)     Press release Norges Bank keeps the interest rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave the interest rate unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 1.75 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. Webcast of press conference (in Norwegian) The objective of monetary policy The operational objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation, with annual consumer price inflation of approximately 2.5 per cent over time. Monetary policy influences the economy with long and variable lags. Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to stabilising inflation at the target within a reasonable time horizon, normally 1-3 years. The more precise horizon will depend on disturbances to which the economy is exposed and how they will affect the path for inflation and the real economy ahead. In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances are not taken into account. Previous assessmentsOn 22 September 2004, the Executive Board decided to keep Norges Bank's key rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent. The Executive Board indicated that low price inflation, in isolation, pointed to a lower interest rate. Moreover, it was emphasised that monetary policy must give weight to avoiding imbalances in the real economy and that developments in aggregate demand warranted caution with regard to further interest rate cuts. The interest rate was last changed on 11 March 2004, when it was reduced by 0.25 percentage point. \r",
      " Economic developments The Executive Board places particular emphasis on the following: \r",
      " Growth in the world economy has been strong. High growth in private consumption in the US and brisk investment growth in China have been the main driving forces, but the recovery has gradually broadened to other countries. However, the growth peak seems to have been passed, and there are prospects that growth among our trading partners will moderate. This is reflected in a decline in long-term interest rates since the previous monetary policy meeting. After accelerating in the US, the euro area and the UK in the second quarter, consumer price inflation has moderated again. Thus far, there are few signs that the sharp rise in oil prices has had an inflationary effect. Underlying inflation remains moderate. The market now expects a less pronounced interest rate increase in the US and the euro area than at the time of the publication of Inflation Report 2/04 on 1 July. The effective US dollar exchange rate has depreciated by about 4 per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting. Even after falling this week, oil prices are high. Since July, the price of Brent Blend has varied between USD 42 and 52 per barrel. Futures prices have also risen in recent months. Oil prices measured in krone terms have not risen to the same extent, owing to the depreciation of the US dollar. Strong global demand for oil products, combined with very low spare production capacity in OPEC, has driven up oil prices. Oil prices also reflect temporary production disruptions in Iraq, unrest in Nigeria and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Inflation measured by the CPI-ATE was lower during the summer than projected in the previous report. In September, the year-on-year rate of increase in prices moved up to 0.5 per cent, approximately in line with the projections in the previous report. The introduction of maximum rates for day-care places, which has a one-off effect on consumer price inflation, and the effects of interest rates on house rents are expected to push down inflation by ¼ percentage point on an annual basis. If the CPI-ATE is adjusted for these two factors, inflation was about ¾ per cent in September. The Norwegian krone has appreciated since the previous monetary policy meeting. Expectations that the interest rate has reached a trough, in conjunction with high spot and futures prices for oil, have probably supported the krone. Output growth is high in Norway. Reports from Norges Bank's regional network point to continued growth and rising activity levels in most industries. As a result of high commodity prices and strong international demand, the conditions for the metal and processing industry have been favourable. Growth in manufacturing sectors supplying the domestic market is rising and is at its strongest level since the network was established. The output gap, as assessed by Norges Bank, is turning positive. Low interest rates, higher petroleum investment and the international recovery are fuelling demand. However, demand has largely been concentrated on imports of goods and services. As a result of a strong real krone exchange rate, the business sector is losing market shares both at home and abroad. In spite of high output growth, employment growth has been moderate thus far. This reflects rationalisation in the business sector. Reports from the regional network suggest that employment will increase in the construction industry, retail trade and other service industries in the near term. In the government budget proposal for 2005, underlying nominal spending growth is estimated at close to 11 per cent between 2003 and 2005. Local government nominal revenues are estimated to rise by a little more than 11 per cent in these two years. This is somewhat higher than nominal mainland GDP growth in the same period. Growth in total household demand remains buoyant. House price inflation is high, but has slowed somewhat since August. Housing starts have increased markedly. Growth in household debt is about 11 per cent. Information from the regional network indicates a moderate rise in investment in the private sector. In manufacturing, investment is concentrated on production automation. In response to higher demand, the retail industry is upgrading and expanding existing premises. Service industries are investing in IT equipment. After falling between 2001 and 2003, prices for office and commercial property have shown a clear increase, rising by 9 per cent in the year to end-June 2004. Credit demand in the enterprise sector is low, but has recently increased. Outlook and risk factorsThe analyses in Inflation Report 3/04 are based on the technical assumption that the interest rate will move in line with forward interest rates. The krone is assumed to follow the forward exchange rate as observed on 28 October. Under this assumption, the krone will be fairly stable in the period ahead. Market participants expect a less pronounced rise in interest rates in Norway than in June. \r",
      " Growth in the Norwegian economy has picked up markedly. It is also assumed that potential output in the Norwegian economy will show a considerable increase. Nevertheless, our projections indicate that growth is higher than growth in potential output, and that capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is approaching a normal level. Capacity utilisation is expected to increase further over the next two years, before edging down again. Inflation, as measured by the CPI-ATE, is projected to pick up in the course of 2005. The depreciation of the krone through 2003 will continue to exert upward pressure on prices for imported consumer goods up to autumn 2005. From 2006, inflation will be gradually pushed up by higher resource utilisation in the Norwegian economy. This will contribute to somewhat higher wage growth and make it possible for enterprises to increase their margins. Inflation is projected to reach 2 per cent in the beginning of 2007. According to the projections, the inflation target will be reached three years ahead. Furthermore, the Executive Board would place particular emphasis on the following factors:  In the short term, high oil prices probably constitute the greatest risk to the outlook for the global economy. High oil prices may lead to a more pronounced slowdown in global growth than projected. This could in turn result in lower demand and lower commodity prices. The effects of high oil prices on the Norwegian economy are mixed. Lower external demand will have a negative impact on some Norwegian manufacturing sectors. At the same time, domestic demand is normally stimulated by higher petroleum investment. The allocations to the Government Petroleum Fund will be higher. The additional central government foreign exchange revenues as a result of high oil prices will be invested in foreign securities through the Government Petroleum Fund. As a result, they will not have a direct impact on the balance in the Norwegian foreign exchange market. Moreover, oil companies probably hold a large share of their cash surplus in foreign currency. In addition, high import growth will contribute to reducing the current account surplus. The projections for potential output are uncertain. We have assumed that potential output will show stronger-than-normal growth this year. If productivity growth remains high for a longer period than projected, this may contribute to keeping down inflation. AssessmentThe objective of monetary policy is inflation of 2½ per cent over time. At present, inflation is considerably lower than this. The key rate is therefore low. Particular weight must be given to factors that may delay an increase in inflation. \r",
      " In the conduct of monetary policy emphasis is also placed on avoiding imbalances in the real economy. Growth in the Norwegian economy is now high and household demand is rising sharply. Housing investment is rising at a faster pace than projected earlier. Developments in credit have given ambiguous signals to interest rate setting. Enterprises have reduced their debt over a period, but this trend now seems to have been reversed. Growth in household borrowing is strong. It is the assessment of the Executive Board that the projections for economic developments imply a sight deposit rate in the interval 1¼ -2¼ per cent in mid-March 2005. Uncertainty as to the effects of previous monetary policy easing and the unusually low interest rate level imply, on the one hand, that we should exercise caution with regard to further interest rate reductions. On the other hand, the prospect of continued low inflation for a period ahead implies that wide deviations from projected economic developments would be required before interest rates should be increased. The prospect of continued low inflation in Norway also implies that we should lag behind other countries in setting interest rates at a more normal level. SummaryThe Executive Board did not see any clear alternatives to leaving the interest rate unchanged. The Executive Board has weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations against the risk that output growth may eventually be too high. \r",

Charts - monetary policy meeting (169 kB)    Press release Norges Bank keeps interest rates unchanged at 1.75 per cent Norges Bank keeps interest rates unchanged at 1.75 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave interest rates unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 1.75 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. The objective of monetary policyThe Government has defined an inflation target for monetary policy in Norway. Norges Bank's operational conduct of monetary policy is oriented towards low and stable inflation. The operational objective for monetary policy is annual consumer price inflation of approximately 2.5 per cent over time. Monetary policy influences the economy with long and variable lags. Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to stabilising inflation at the target within a reasonable time horizon, normally 1-3 years. The more precise horizon will depend on disturbances to which the economy is exposed and how they will affect the path for inflation and the real economy ahead. In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances are not taken into account. Norges Bank places particular emphasis on CPI inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) when assessing underlying inflation. Previous assessmentsThe Executive Board decided on 11 August 2004 to leave interest rates unchanged at 1.75 per cent. The interest rate was last changed on 11 March 2004, when it was reduced by 0.25 percentage point. In Inflation Report 2/04, presented on 1 July, mainland GDP growth was projected to pick up markedly this year and remain relatively high next year. The output level will be slightly higher than implied by the trend level, i.e. the output gap is projected to be marginally positive in the period 2005-2007. Inflation, as measured by the CPI-ATE, is expected to rise towards the end of the year and to show a moderate increase in the period 2005-2007. In the baseline scenario in the report, inflation remains below target up to summer 2007. Norges Bank indicated that monetary policy should be oriented towards pushing up inflation at a somewhat faster pace than projected. The monetary stance is therefore expansionary. The Executive Board's assessment in July was that the economic outlook implies a sight deposit rate in the interval 1¼ - 2¼ per cent at the beginning of November 2004. The Executive Board also indicated that uncertainty concerning the effects of previous monetary policy easing and the unusually low interest rate imply that we should exercise caution with regard to further interest rate reductions. Given the prospect of continued low inflation for a period ahead, wide deviations from projected economic developments would be required before the interest rate should be increased within the strategy period: Economic developmentsThe Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting:  Growth in total output among our trading partners slowed in the second quarter of 2004, after having expanded since the first quarter of 2003. The slowdown was particularly pronounced in Japan, but also in evidence in the US. In the euro area, growth continued at a moderate pace. On the other hand, the economic upturn gained momentum in the UK and Sweden. Inflation in the US and the euro area, adjusted for the effects of higher energy prices, has stabilised in recent months, after rising earlier this year. Key rates have been raised by 0.25 percentage point since the middle of August in the US, Canada, Switzerland and New Zealand. The central bank of Iceland has increased its key rate by 0.5 percentage point. Financial market expectations of a gradual interest rate increase in many countries are broadly in line with the expectations prevailing around the previous monetary policy meeting. Equity prices in the US, Europe and Japan fell in July and the first weeks of August, but have since edged up. Oil prices have hovered above USD 40 per barrel. High global oil demand and very low excess production capacity are contributing to high oil prices. Oil prices also reflect production disruptions in Iraq. Inflation in Norway has been low. Consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) rose by 0.1 per cent in the year to August 2004. Even though prices for imported consumer gods measured in foreign currency are now rising and the effective krone exchange rate has been fairly stable, prices for these goods, as measured in the CPI in August, fell more than in previous months. Adjusted for the interest rate's direct effect on house rents and changes in day-care rates, the year-on-year rise is estimated at ½ per cent. In the past three months, inflation has been lower than projected in Inflation Report 2/04. According to TNS Gallup's expectations survey, inflation expectations two years ahead have been reduced, while inflation expectations five years ahead are stable at a little less than 2½ per cent. The krone exchange rate, as measured by a broad index (I-44), has not exhibited a clear trend since spring, but has probably been supported by high oil prices. Since the previous monetary policy meeting, the krone has depreciated by about 1 per cent. In Norway, market interest rate expectations were lowered after publication of the CPI for august. Forward interest rates indicate that the market expects an increase in the key rate next summer. The interest rate differential against trading partners is expected to remain negative up to 2007. TNS Gallup's third-quarter survey indicates that business leaders and households have lowered their interest rate expectations for the next twelve months. The Norwegian economy is expanding at a solid pace. According to preliminary figures from Statistics Norway, mainland GDP grew by 3.7 per cent between the first half of 2003 and the first half of 2004. Mainland growth primarily reflects increased activity in retail trade, the construction sector and service industries. Imports are rising sharply. There are prospects of continued strong growth in petroleum investment next year. Employment is rising moderately. The number of vacancies has increased in recent months, and registered unemployment edged down in August, adjusted for normal seasonal variations. According to TNS Gallup's business sentiment survey, business leaders consider profitability to be better than it has been for a long period. Household sentiment concerning personal finances and the national economy became increasingly positive over the summer. House price inflation is high. Residential construction is expanding at a fast pace. Commercial building starts have also picked up, particularly in retail trade. Rents for office premises have been stable in recent months. Household debt accumulation is high. Credit demand in the enterprise sector is low, but may be on the rise. The outlook and risk factorsNew information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting indicates that growth in the Norwegian economy will be somewhat stronger in the period ahead than projected in Inflation Report 2/04. Survey results indicate higher investment in the oil and gas sector. Interest rate expectations are lower. \r",
      " The rise in prices in the twelve months to August was lower than projected in the previous Inflation Report. Prices for clothing and footwear continued to decline at a faster pace than expected. Low retail prices for such goods may be attributable to structural changes in retail trade, intensified competition and a shift in trade patterns. The fall in clothing and footwear prices is nevertheless more pronounced than in comparable countries. The low rate of consumer price inflation also reflects a slower rise in house rents and a marked fall in the rate of increase in food prices. The depreciation of the Norwegian krone through 2003, the low interest rate level and solid growth in the real economy may gradually push up inflation. Price developments in recent months have nevertheless increased the risk that inflation will remain low for a longer period. Furthermore, the Executive Board would place particular emphasis on the following factors: There is considerable uncertainty as to the effects on prices and growth in production capacity as a result of the structural changes we have observed in many goods and services markets. Investment in the petroleum sector may be higher in 2005 than assumed earlier. The effects of high oil prices on global economic growth and externally generated price impulses may have a direct or indirect impact on the Norwegian economy. High oil prices do not appear to have made any considerable contribution to raising inflation expectations, but may curb economic growth in other countries. Lower growth in the world economy may restrain the rise in international interest rates. In periods, high oil prices and unrest in the Middle East result in rising demand for the Norwegian krone. Higher central government foreign exchange earnings are, however, invested in foreign securities through the Government Petroleum Fund and therefore do not have a direct impact on balance in the Norwegian foreign exchange market.AssessmentParticular weight must be given to factors that may delay an increase in inflation. The exchange rate, long-term inflation expectations and the growth and inflation outlook in other countries have shown little change in recent months. However, inflation in Norway has not increased in line with projections. Markedly lower-than-projected inflation may, if this reflects structural changes in the goods and service markets, indicate lower inflation also over a period ahead. In isolation, this points to an easing of monetary policy. \r",
      " In the conduct of monetary policy, emphasis is also placed on avoiding imbalances in the real economy. There are signs that growth in the Norwegian economy may be somewhat stronger than projected. Intensified competition in many product markets and a high degree of flexibility in, for example, the construction sector will probably reduce the likelihood of abrupt and pronounced increases in wage and price inflation in the near term. Developments in aggregate demand nevertheless warrant caution with regard to further interest rate reductions. The household debt burden is high and rising, but the interest rate burden is moderate owing to low interest rates. Signs of rising credit demand in the enterprise sector increase the risk that overall credit growth may gradually reach an excessive level. Prospects of continued low inflation in Norway imply that Norway should not be the frontrunner in relation to other countries in setting interest rates at a more normal level. SummaryLow price inflation in recent months points, in isolation, to lower interest rates, but there are also signs that growth in the Norwegian economy may be somewhat higher than projected. The Executive Board has concluded that it is appropriate to leave the interest rate unchanged at present. In reaching its decision, the Executive Board has weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations against the risk that output growth may eventually by too high.

Charts - monetary policy meeting (185 kB)    Press release Norges Bank keeps interest rates unchanged at 1.75 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave interest rates unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 1.75 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. The objective of monetary policyThe Government has defined an inflation target for monetary policy in Norway. Norges Bank's operational conduct of monetary policy is oriented towards low and stable inflation. The operational objective for monetary policy is annual consumer price inflation of approximately 2.5 per cent over time. Monetary policy influences the economy with long and variable lags. Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to stabilising inflation at the target within a reasonable time horizon, normally 1-3 years. The more precise horizon will depend on disturbances to which the economy is exposed and how they will affect the path for inflation and the real economy ahead. In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances are not taken into account. Norges Bank places particular emphasis on CPI inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) when assessing underlying inflation. Previous assessmentsThe Executive Board decided on 1 July 2004 to leave interest rates unchanged at 1.75 per cent. The interest rate was last changed on 11 March 2004, when it was reduced by 0.25 percentage point. In Inflation Report 2/04, presented on 1 July, mainland GDP growth is projected to pick up markedly this year and remain relatively high next year. The output level will be slightly higher than implied by the trend level, i.e. the output gap is projected to be marginally positive in the period 2005-2007. Inflation, as measured by the CPI-ATE, is expected to rise towards the end of the year and to show a moderate increase in the period 2005-2007. In the baseline scenario in the report, inflation remains below target up to summer 2007. The analyses in Inflation Report 2/04 are based on the technical assumption that interest rates will move in line with forward interest rates. The analyses are also based on the assumption that the krone exchange rate will shadow the path for the forward exchange rate as observed on 24 June. At that time, market pricing reflected expectations of a fairly stable exchange rate ahead. Norges Bank indicated, however, that monetary policy should be aimed at increasing inflation at a somewhat faster pace than projected and that a more expansionary monetary policy ahead than indicated by forward interest rates and the forward exchange rate may contribute to this. The Executive Board's assessment was that the economic outlook implies a sight deposit rate in the interval 1¼ - 2¼ per cent at the beginning of November 2004. Economic developmentsThe Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting:  After rising sharply for several quarters, economic growth in the US declined in the second quarter and employment growth appears to have slowed this summer. Economic growth has picked up from a low level in the euro area. Economic growth has also picked up in Sweden and the UK. Inflation has edged up in both the US and the euro area, also when figures are adjusted for the effects of higher energy prices. In the US, the UK and New Zealand, the key rate has been raised by 0.25 percentage point. Financial market expectations indicate gradual interest rate increases in a number of countries, but expectations have been lowered recently. Equity prices in the US, Europe and Japan have fallen in July and so far in August. Oil prices have risen to approximately USD 42 per barrel. According to oil market expectations, oil prices are expected to remain high for a fairly long period, and even oil purchased for delivery in six to seven years is currently priced at close to USD 35 per barrel. Oil demand has risen sharply during this upturn, and there appears to be little excess production capacity. Periodic interruptions in oil deliveries from Iraq, fears of terror and uncertainty with regard to the Russian energy company Yukos are also affecting the oil market. Inflation remains low in Norway. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was 0.2 per cent in July 2004. Adjusted for some temporary factors, the rise over the past twelve months was 0.5 per cent.1 Inflation, calculated over a shorter period, edged up early this spring but has since declined. Overall, prices have risen somewhat less in June and July than projected in the previous Inflation Report. The krone, as measured by a broad index (I-44), depreciated following the publication of the consumer price index for May and up to the beginning of July. After the previous monetary policy meeting, the krone was fairly stable for a long period, but has appreciated in the last few days and is now about 1½ per cent stronger than was the case prior to the previous monetary policy meeting. Market participants have revised down their expectations concerning interest rate developments in Norway. Market participants now seem to expect the key rate to remain unchanged up to the beginning of the second quarter of 2005. In Norway, retail trade developments have been affected by the transport workers' strike, but underlying growth in private consumption appears to have been fairly high in the second quarter. Imports of goods excluding ships and oil platforms rose sharply in the second quarter, while exports of the same goods fell slightly. Manufacturing output is picking up somewhat, and Statistics Norway's business tendency survey for the second quarter indicates that the positive trend will continue. Statistics Norway's latest LFS figures indicate that employment rose somewhat in the spring months. Activity in the housing market is high. Both housing starts and house prices are rising sharply. Commercial building starts have also increased in recent months, particularly in the retail trade sector. Growth in household borrowing increased further in June, while corporate debt continues to decline. The outlook and risk factorsNew information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting has not led to any significant change in the assessments of developments in the real economy in Inflation Report 2/04. The rise in prices over the past twelve months to July was somewhat lower than projected in Inflation Report 2/04. This is partly due to early summer sales of, for example, clothing and furniture. Inflationary impulses may also have been generally weaker than expected. The effects of oil price developments on the Norwegian economy are mixed. Persistently higher oil prices may eventually contribute to higher petroleum investment and increased activity in sectors affected by petroleum activities. A sharp rise in oil prices, however, restrains global economic growth and affects demand for our other export products. In some cases, a sharp rise in oil prices and unrest in the Middle East has boosted demand for the Norwegian krone. However, the extra revenues to the central government due to higher oil prices will be invested in foreign securities through the Petroleum Fund. Thus, higher foreign exchange revenues will not have a direct effect on the balance in the Norwegian foreign exchange market. High oil prices are resulting in increased fuel and heating expenses for Norwegian firms and households. In addition, high oil prices are pushing up inflation abroad, with an attendant increase in domestic consumer prices via imports. In addition to the effect of the rise in oil prices, important risks to the inflation outlook in the coming years are generally the same as indicated at the previous monetary policy meeting:  If developments in the krone exchange rate differ from the assumptions in Inflation Report 2/04, the inflation outlook will be affected. The feed-through from the krone exchange rate to consumer prices is, however, uncertain. The key rate has been reduced from 7 per cent in December 2002 to 1.75 per cent in March 2004. We have little experience of such considerable and rapid monetary policy easing and such a low nominal interest rate level. Labour shortages may arise more rapidly than assumed and as a result wage growth may be higher than projected. On the other hand, competitiveness in manufacturing industry and low inflation may be given greater emphasis in the wage negotiations. This may then result in wage growth that is lower than projected. Projections for developments in productivity and growth in potential output are uncertain. Inflation abroad may also rise more rapidly than projected if wage growth picks up or higher demand translates into higher profit margins. In that case, this might contribute to higher inflation in Norway. On the other hand, growth in China and other Asian countries may slow, resulting in lower commodity prices. It is also possible that the shift towards imports from low-cost countries will be broader than assumed by Norges Bank in the Inflation Report. AssessmentThe aim of monetary policy is higher inflation. The monetary policy stance is therefore expansionary. With the current low level of inflation, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant as regards developments in consumer prices. However, consumer prices may show erratic variations from one month to the next. Monetary policy also places emphasis on avoiding imbalances in the real economy. Uncertainty concerning the effects of previous monetary policy easing and the unusually low interest rate imply that we should exercise caution with regard to further interest rate reductions. With the prospect of continued low inflation for a period ahead, wide deviations from projected economic developments would be required before the interest rate should be increased. The prospect of continued low inflation in Norway also implies that Norway should not be the frontrunner when interest rates are increased in other countries. Low inflation in June and July is partly due to temporary factors. The coming months will confirm whether the unexpectedly low level of inflation is also due to the persistence of generally weaker price impulses, or whether inflation rises as projected by Norges Bank in the previous Inflation Report. Growth in household borrowing increased further in June. The debt burden is high and households are thereby more vulnerable to economic disturbances. Corporate debt continues to decline. New information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting does not imply any significant change in the balance between the objective of reaching the inflation target and stability in the real economy in relation to the Inflation Report. SummaryThe Executive Board has come to the conclusion that it is appropriate to keep the key interest rate unchanged. The Executive Board did not find any clear alternative to an unchanged interest rate at this monetary policy meeting. In reaching its decision, the Executive Board weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and of stable inflation expectations against the risk that output growth may eventually be too high. The Executive Board's assessment remains unchanged, i.e. that the inflation outlook may imply an unchanged interest rate for a longer period than assumed in the projections in the Inflation Report.

Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 1.75 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. The objective of monetary policyThe Government has defined an inflation target for monetary policy in Norway. Norges Bank's operational conduct of monetary policy is oriented towards low and stable inflation. The operational objective is annual consumer price inflation of approximately 2.5 per cent over time. Monetary policy influences the economy with long and variable lags.

In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances are not taken into account. Norges Bank places particular emphasis on CPI inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) when assessing underlying inflation. Previous assessmentsInterest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 26 May 2004. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, remained at 1.75 per cent. It was also stated that \"with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher\". The interest rate was last changed on 11 March 2004, when it was reduced by 0.25 percentage point. Economic developmentsThe Executive Board has placed particular emphasis on the following factors:  The global cyclical upturn has gained a firmer footing. In recent months, growth has also picked up in several euro area countries. International inflation has edged up in recent months, primarily reflecting a sharp rise in prices for many commodities, particularly oil. However, the outlook for wage growth points to continued moderate inflation. Financial market expectations imply a gradual rise in interest rates in several countries in the period ahead. Inflation in Norway is low. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was 0.1 per cent in May 2004. The rise was 1.6 per cent1 for the last three months, annualised. Developments in recent months have been broadly in line with the projections in the March Inflation Report. The krone exchange rate, measured by a broad index (I-44), appreciated markedly from mid-February to the beginning of May. The krone has varied somewhat and has depreciated by about 2½ per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting. Interest rate expectations in Norway increased during the spring. Market expectations seem to indicate an interest rate increase of ¼ percentage point towards the end of 2004. This implies a key rate of about 2 per cent at the end of the year. Growth in the Norwegian economy slowed in 2002 and was low in the first half of 2003. Activity has picked up since then. Growth in household borrowing is high. Housing investment has started to rise again. Low inflation has led to solid growth in real wages, in spite of relatively low nominal pay increases in this year's wage settlement. Private consumption is exhibiting brisk growth. There are some signs of a pick-up in mainland business investment. At the same time, the vacancy rate for office premises is high and enterprises are still reducing their debt. Norges Bank's regional network reports continued growth and rising activity levels in most industries. Market developments are positive. Unemployment seems to have levelled off after having risen through 2002 and 2003. Productivity growth in the mainland economy is probably fairly high. Employment is rising only moderately, despite solid output growth. The outlook ahead and risk factorsThe analyses in Inflation Report 2/04 are based on a technical assumption that interest rates will move in line with forward interest rates. The analyses are also based on the assumption that the krone exchange rate will shadow the path for the forward exchange rate as observed on 24 June. At that time, market pricing reflected expectations of a fairly stable exchange rate ahead. Growth in mainland GDP is projected to pick up markedly in 2004 and remain relatively high next year. Growth is expected to be somewhat higher than the increase in production capacity. The output gap is estimated to be marginally positive in 2005 to 2007. Inflation, measured by the CPI-ATE, is projected to edge up towards the end of the year, mainly due to the depreciation of the krone in 2003. Inflation is expected to increase moderately in the period from 2005 to 2007. In the baseline scenario in Inflation Report 2/04, inflation remains below target up to summer 2007. The Executive Board has assessed the following important risks to the inflation outlook over the coming years:  The krone exchange rate has shown substantial changes since the March Inflation Report. Exchange rate expectations, as reflected in the forward exchange rate, have also varied considerably. A krone exchange rate path that deviates from the assumption in Inflation Report 2/04 will influence the inflation outlook. The feed-through from the krone exchange rate to consumer prices is uncertain. The key rate has been reduced from 7 per cent in December 2002 to 1.75 per cent in March 2004. We have little experience of such considerable and rapid monetary policy easing and such a low nominal interest rate level. If labour shortages arise more rapidly than we have assumed, wage growth may be higher than projected. On the other hand, competitiveness in manufacturing industry and low inflation may be given more emphasis in wage negotiations. This may then result in wage growth that is lower than projected. Projections for developments in productivity and potential output are uncertain. Global inflation may rise more rapidly than projected if wage growth moves up or prices for oil and other commodities continue to rise. This might contribute to higher inflation in Norway. On the other hand, growth in China and other Asian countries may slow and result in lower commodity prices. Oil prices have fallen in the past few days, partly as a result of higher oil stocks, and are unstable. It is also possible that the shift in Norway's imports towards low-cost countries is more substantial than we have assumed. AssessmentsThe aim of monetary policy is higher inflation. The monetary policy stance is therefore expansionary. With the current low level of inflation, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant as regards developments in consumer prices. However, consumer prices may show erratic variations from month to month. Several monthly observations show that the rise in prices since the March Inflation Report has been consistent with our projections. Over the next few months, we will receive further confirmation of whether consumer prices are rising in line with our projections. Monetary policy also places emphasis on avoiding imbalances in the real economy. Credit developments are still giving ambiguous signals to our interest-rate setting. Growth in household borrowing is strong, while enterprises are reducing their debt. All in all, the financial stability outlook is satisfactory. However, high debt growth makes households more vulnerable to economic disturbances. Given the assumptions underlying the projections in Inflation Report 2/04, inflation will remain somewhat lower than the inflation target up to autumn 2006. Capacity utilisation in the economy is increasing, and the output gap is expected to turn marginally positive during the projection period. Monetary policy should be aimed at increasing inflation at a somewhat faster pace than projected in the Inflation Report. The most appropriate alternative now seems to be that the interest rate should be kept unchanged for a longer period than indicated by market expectations. The prospect of continued low inflation in Norway also implies that Norway should not be the frontrunner when interest rates are increased in other countries. The Executive Board's assessment is that the economic projections imply a sight deposit rate in the interval 1¼ - 2¼% at the beginning of November 2004. If the krone appreciates substantially, this may provide a basis for considering an interest rate at the lower end of, or below, the interval. The unusually low interest rate and uncertainty concerning the effects of previous monetary policy easing imply that we should exercise caution with regard to further interest rate reductions. On the other hand, given the prospect of low inflation ahead, wide deviations from projected economic developments would be required before it would be appropriate to increase the interest rate in the period to the beginning of November 2004. SummaryThe Executive Board has come to the conclusion that it is appropriate to keep the key interest rate unchanged at this time. The Executive Board did not find any clear alternative to an unchanged interest rate at this monetary policy meeting. In reaching its decision, the Executive Board has weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations against the risk that output growth may eventually be too high. According to the Executive Board's assessment, the inflation outlook may imply an unchanged interest rate for a longer period than implied by the interest rate assumptions in Inflation Report 2/04.

Charts - monetary policy meeting (141 kB)    Press release Norges Bank keeps interest rates unchanged at 1.75 per cent Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 26 May 2004. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 1.75 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The objective of monetary policyThe Government has defined an inflation target for monetary policy in Norway. The operational objective is a rise in consumer prices of 2½ per cent over time. In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances are not taken into account. Norges Bank places particular emphasis on CPI inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) when assessing underlying inflation. Normally, Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to achieving an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead. Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime, so that variability in both output and inflation is given weight. Previous assessmentsInterest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 21 April 2004. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, remained at 1.75 per cent. It was also stated that \"with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher.\" In Norges Bank's Inflation Report 1/04, mainland GDP growth was projected to pick up markedly this year and remain relatively high in 2005 and 2006. The output level will gradually be slightly higher than the trend level would imply. In Inflation Report 1/04, CPI-ATE inflation was projected to remain somewhat below the inflation target next year. According to the report, there are prospects that inflation will move up to the inflation target of 2½ per cent two years ahead. Economic developmentsThe Executive Board has placed particular emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting: In Inflation Report 1/04, Norges Bank projected that growth in the global economy would pick up through 2004 and would also be solid in 2005. At present, growth among trading partners as a whole appears to have been somewhat stronger in the first quarter than assumed by Norges Bank. Market participants now expect interest rates to rise at a somewhat faster pace in a number of countries. It is now expected that the key interest rate in the US will be increased at the end of June and that the ECB will raise its key rate towards the end of the year. There are signs of a somewhat sharper rise in consumer prices internationally than projected in the Inflation Report, partly as a result of the rise in prices for oil and other commodities. The spot price for oil has increased and has recently been around USD 38 per barrel. Oil futures have also risen markedly, by USD 2-4. Prices for other internationally traded goods are also moving up. In both March and April, inflation in Norway was approximately as projected in the Inflation Report. In April, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 0.2 per cent. Adjusted for some temporary factors, the year-on-year rise was 0.5 per cent.1 The rate of increase in the last three months2 was 1.1 per cent annualised. TNS Gallup's expectations survey indicates that expectations concerning inflation ahead remain stable at about 2½ per cent. The krone exchange rate, as measured by a broad index (I-44), has appreciated by about 4 per cent since the publication of Inflation Report 1/04. The krone is approximately 1 per cent stronger than before the last monetary policy meeting on 21 April. Pricing in markets indicates that there has been little change in market participant's expectations concerning short-term interest rates in Norway for the next year, but expectations have been revised upwards for our trading partners. At a horizon of more than 1-1½ years, interest rate expectations in Norway have increased more than among our trading partners. Activity in the Norwegian economy is picking up. Goods consumption continued to expand in the first quarter. TNS Gallup's consumer confidence indicator fell slightly in the second quarter, but remains at a high level. Housing starts in the first quarter were at approximately the same level as in the first quarter of 2003, but commercial building starts have declined. Statistics Norway's business tendency survey for the first quarter of 2004 suggests clearly positive developments for manufacturing. Unemployment is stable, despite solid output growth. Employment is rising only moderately, which indicates high growth in productivity. Norges Bank's regional network reports that activity levels are increasing in most industries. The growth outlook for the next six months is considered favourable. The network reports moderate growth in investment plans for the private and public sectors. Employment in the business sector is rising moderately with the exception of manufacturing. Employment in the public sector and manufacturing is reported to be approximately unchanged. Annual wage growth is projected to be lower in 2004 than in 2003. Profitability is reported to have improved in the business sector. After having climbed since the summer of 2003, house prices fell slightly from March to April. Growth in household borrowing edged up to 11.1 per cent in March. Corporate debt shows negative growth. The government accounts for 2003 show a larger, structural non-oil deficit than estimated in the National Budget for 2004. As a result, the fiscal stimulus from 2002 to 2004 will be stronger than previously planned. Measured in value, underlying spending growth over the government budget is estimated at nearly 5 per cent in both 2003 and 2004. At the same time, it is likely that local government revenues will increase by 11 per cent from 2002 to 2004. Results from groups that have completed wage negotiations in this year's wage settlement do not imply a change in Norges Bank's projections for wage growth this year. Large groups of employees have yet to begin their wage negotiations. The outlook and risk factorsThe Executive Board has assessed the outlook and the following important risk factors: Growth in the Norwegian economy is probably somewhat stronger than projected in Inflation Report 1/04, but capacity utilisation at the end of 2003 may have been somewhat lower than projected earlier. Consumer prices have moved approximately in line with projections in Inflation Report 1/04. The appreciation of the Norwegian krone in recent months will, if it continues, push inflation down at the 1-3 year horizon. Inflation in other countries remains subdued, but there are signs of somewhat higher consumer price inflation in the US, the euro area, Sweden and China. In the short term, the rise in oil prices and other commodities will contribute to somewhat higher inflation in other countries. On the other hand, shifts in import patterns from high-cost to low-cost countries may be more pronounced than assumed earlier. Monetary policy is generating a strong stimulus to the Norwegian economy. We have limited experience of the effects of such a low nominal interest rate level abroad and in Norway. Labour shortages may emerge more rapidly than estimated. Wage growth may then rise more than expected. Inflation is unusually low. This may contribute to a greater extent than assumed earlier to low nominal wage growth ahead. AssessmentsThe aim of monetary policy is higher inflation. With the current low level of inflation, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant with regard to developments in consumer prices. However, consumer prices may show random variations from one month to the next. We now have several monthly observations showing a rise in prices that is consistent with the most recent forecasts. Later this year, we will receive further confirmation of whether consumer prices are rising in line with our projections. We also place emphasis on avoiding imbalances in the real economy. The economy is probably approaching a normal rate of capacity utilisation. When inflation increases from a very low level, this will provide a basis for gradually moving towards a more normal short-term interest rate level in Norway. This may counter excessive credit growth and excessive pressures on domestic resources in the medium term. Interest rate developments abroad may also have a considerable influence on movements in the krone exchange rate. The inflation outlook in Norway implies that Norway will not be the frontrunner when other countries increase interest rates. Some factors support a reduction in the interest rate. The exchange rate is stronger than projected in Inflation Report 1/04 and will contribute to pushing down inflation in the next couple of years. In periods, the krone is heavily influenced by developments in the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries. This is given weight in interest-rate setting. However, themes in the foreign exchange market shift, and Norges Bank does not have instruments to fine-tune the exchange rate. The krone depreciated in 2003. This will contribute to pushing up inflation through 2004. Apart from this, the overall price impulses to the Norwegian economy will be small and wage growth will probably be moderate. Productivity growth appears to be high and competition has increased in a number of markets. Prices for imported goods measured in foreign currency have fallen. Even though higher commodity prices may contribute to somewhat higher inflation in other countries and to curbing a decline in prices for imported consumer goods, external price impulses will probably remain weak. As mentioned previously, the stronger krone in recent months will also curb price impulses. Other factors indicate that the interest rate should not be reduced at this time. Short-term interest rates in Norway are low. The impact of monetary policy occurs with a lag. There are signs that demand and output are picking up at a somewhat faster pace than projected in the Inflation Report. Capacity utilisation may gradually be fairly high. After a surprisingly sharp fall in inflation in Norway last autumn and winter, inflation has stabilised and in March and April was approximately on a par with projections in the Inflation Report 1/04. Household borrowing is high. In the months ahead, developments in corporate demand for credit may provide a clearer indication of to what extent the upturn in the real economy has also gained a footing in the business sector. SummaryThe Executive Board has considered two main alternatives: reducing the interest rate by 0.25 percentage point or keeping the interest rate unchanged. The Executive Board has come to the conclusion that it is appropriate to keep the key interest rate unchanged at this time. In reaching its decision, the Executive Board has weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations against the risk that output growth may eventually be too high. According to the Executive Board's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The inflation outlook in Norway implies that Norway will not be the frontrunner when other countries increase interest rates.

      " Charts - monetary policy meeting    Press release Norges Bank keeps interest rates unchanged at 1.75 per cent Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank's Executive Board meeting on 21 April 2004. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 1.75 per cent. The overnight lending rate also remains unchanged. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The objective of monetary policyThe Government has defined an inflation target for monetary policy in Norway. The operational objective is an inflation rate of 2½ per cent over time. In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances are not taken into account. Norges Bank places particular emphasis on CPI inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) when assessing underlying inflation. Normally, Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to achieving an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead. Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime, so that variability in both output and inflation is given weight. Previous assessmentsOn 11 March 2004, Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to reduce the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.75 per cent. It was also stated that \"with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher.\" In Norges Bank's Inflation Report 1/04, mainland GDP growth was projected to pick up markedly this year and remain relatively high in 2005 and 2006. The output level will be slightly higher than the trend level would imply. This means that the output gap, as calculated by Norges Bank, will be marginally positive in 2005 and 2006, after having been slightly negative this year. In Inflation Report 1/04, CPI-ATE inflation was projected to remain somewhat below the inflation target next year. Two years ahead, there are prospects that inflation will move up to the inflation target of 2½ per cent. The analyses are based on the assumption that the sight deposit rate moves in line with forward interest rates prevailing at the beginning of March and that the krone follows expectations as reflected in the forward exchange market. This implied that the interest rate would be reduced to 1½ per cent by summer 2004 and thereafter increased gradually. Economic developmentsThe Executive Board has placed particular emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting:  Underlying inflation is low. The rate of increase in the last three months was 0.5 per cent1 annualised. In March, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 0.3 per cent. The rise in prices was somewhat higher than projected in the Inflation Report, primarily due to developments in import prices and house rents. Prices for imported consumer goods are nevertheless 2.7 per cent lower than one year earlier. The krone, as measured by a broad index (I-44), is now approximately 3½ per cent stronger than before the monetary policy meeting in March. The krone appreciated in the first days after the last monetary policy meeting and after publication of the consumer price index for March. Global economic growth is broadly in line with projections in the Inflation Report. The recovery in the US has also taken hold in the labour market. Economic indicators for continental Europe provide mixed signals. The rise in US consumer prices accelerated in March. Inflation is very low in the Nordic countries. Equity prices in the US and Europe are at approximately the same level as at the beginning of March, while the recovery continues in Japan. Bond yields have increased markedly in a number of countries. Market participants have revised up their interest rate expectations for several countries. The key rate in the US is now expected to be increased by ¼ percentage point in late summer. Pricing in markets indicates that there is a small probability of an interest rate reduction in the euro area before the summer. In Sweden and Canada, interest rates have been reduced by 0.50 and 0.25 percentage point, respectively, to 2 per cent. Oil prices remain high at USD 30-35 per barrel. Prices for other important export goods such as aluminium and fish also remain high. Market participants have revised up their expectations concerning Norwegian interest rate developments. In financial and foreign exchange markets, pricing in the forward market points to expectations of an unchanged sight deposit rate up to the autumn of 2004 and then a gradual increase. The short-term interest rate level, which is currently lower than among our trading partners, is expected to be approximately on a par with interest rates abroad in summer 2005. Bond yields in Norway have increased somewhat more than in other countries. Activity in the Norwegian economy is picking up, in accordance with Norges Bank's assumptions in the Inflation Report. According to preliminary figures from Statistics Norway, mainland GDP rose by 0.8 per cent from the third to the fourth quarter of 2003. Goods consumption declined somewhat in February 2004, but this can fluctuate from one month to the next. New car registrations are increasing. According to preliminary figures from Statistics Norway, private mainland investment picked up somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2003, especially in service industries, but housing investment and manufacturing investment also rose. Housing starts have been high so far this year. Commercial building starts continue to decline. Activity in the housing market is high, with a sharp rise in prices for resale homes. Twelve-month growth in total credit to households and the mainland business sector fell to 5.2 per cent in December and remained unchanged in January. Household debt is showing high and stable growth, while growth in corporate debt remains low or negative. Employment has risen gradually, and unemployment is fairly stable, in line with the analyses in the Inflation Report. Results from groups that have completed wage negotiations in this year's wage settlement do not imply a substantial change in Norges Bank's projections for annual wage growth this year. Large groups of employees have yet to begin their wage negotiations. The outlook and risk factorsThe Executive Board has assessed the outlook and the following important risk factors:  Price developments for imported consumer goods are uncertain. Our projections are based on a gradually slower decline in prices for these goods measured in foreign currency. There is still a risk that inflation among our trading partners may remain lower than projected in the period ahead. Projections in the Inflation Report are based on the assumption that import prices will pick up through 2004 as a result of the exchange rate depreciation in 2003. It cannot be ruled out that import prices in the next few months will rise faster than assumed by Norges Bank. On the other hand, the appreciation of the krone in the last few weeks, if it persists, will curb inflation at the one to two-year horizon. Labour shortages may emerge more rapidly than estimated. Wage growth may then rise at a faster pace than assumed in the Inflation Report, as for example, if growth in salaries for white-collar workers again accelerates. Weak competitiveness in Norwegian manufacturing may have the opposite effect. Rationalisation in the business sector may enable companies to increase output considerably without strong growth in employment. This suggests that there is room for somewhat stronger growth in the economy than earlier without the emergence of pressures on economic resources. Monetary policy is now generating a fairly strong stimulus to the Norwegian economy. Our experience of such a considerable and rapid monetary policy easing is limited. The effect on total demand for goods and services may be greater than we have estimated. AssessmentsThe aim of monetary policy is higher inflation. With the current low level of inflation, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant with regard to developments in consumer prices. However, consumer prices may show random variations from one month to the next. Later this year, we will receive confirmation of whether consumer prices are rising in line with our projections. When inflation increases from a very low level, this will provide a basis for gradually moving towards a more normal short-term interest rate level in Norway. This may counter excessive credit growth and excessive pressures on domestic resources in the medium term. Interest rate developments in other countries may also have a considerable impact on the krone and hence on Norwegian interest rates. There are factors that support a further easing of monetary policy now.  Following the monetary policy meeting on 11 March, Norges Bank stated that a path that is in line with the projections in Inflation Report 1/04 provides a reasonable balance between the prospects for reaching the inflation target and stable developments in the real economy. So far, demand, output and employment have generally developed in line with the projections in the Inflation Report. Inflation at the present time is somewhat higher than projected, but this alone does not imply higher inflation at the one to two-year horizon. On the other hand, the exchange rate has appreciated since the last monetary policy meeting. Past experience shows that in periods the krone is heavily influenced by developments in the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries. This is given weight in interest-rate setting. However, themes in the foreign exchange market shift, and Norges Bank does not have instruments to fine-tune the exchange rate. Nevertheless, a reduction in the key rate might partly offset the tightening which a stronger exchange rate represents. The krone depreciated in 2003. This will contribute to pushing up inflation through 2004. Apart from this, the overall price impulses to the Norwegian economy will be limited. Wage growth will probably be moderate. Productivity growth appears to be high and competition has increased in a number of markets. Prices for imported goods measured in foreign currency have fallen. Even though higher commodity prices may contribute to somewhat higher inflation in other countries and to curbing the decline in prices for imported consumer goods, external price impulses will probably remain weak. A period of too low inflation may influence inflation expectations among economic agents. Low inflation may therefore be self-reinforcing. A number of factors also indicate that we should now await additional information before any further reduction of the interest rate. \r",
      " Although developments in continental Europe are still uncertain, the recovery in the global economy has gained a firmer footing, through strong growth also in the US labour market. Short-term interest rates in Norway are low. The impact of monetary policy occurs with a lag. Information that has emerged since the last monetary policy meeting confirms that activity in the Norwegian economy is moving up. After a surprisingly sharp fall in inflation in Norway last autumn and winter, inflation has stabilised and increased somewhat recently and is now slightly higher than projections in Inflation Report 1/04 Household borrowing is high. In the months ahead, developments in corporate demand for credit may provide a clearer indication of to what extent the upturn in the real economy has also gained a footing in the business sector.

Charts - monetary policy meeting    Press release Norges Bank reduces the key interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.75 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to reduce the interest rate on banks' deposits with Norges Bank, the sight deposit rate, by 0.25 percentage point to 1.75 per cent with effect from 12 March 2004. The interest rate on banks' overnight loans is being reduced correspondingly. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher.

Normally, Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to achieving an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead. Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime, so that variability in both output and employment and inflation is given weight. Previous assessmentsOn 28 January 2004, Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to reduce the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 per cent. It was also stated that \"with a sight deposit rate of 2.00 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher.\" In reaching its decision, the Executive Board weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations against the risk that output growth might eventually be too high. Economic developmentsParticular emphasis has been placed on the following:  Underlying inflation is very low. The rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) has edged down since last summer. Annual CPI-ATE inflation was -0.1 per cent in February. After showing a tendency to appreciate in autumn 2003, the krone has weakened markedly since early December. The krone, as measured by a broad index, is now at the level prevailing at the beginning of 2002 and in line with the level in the mid-1990s. In recent months, market participants have lowered their interest rate expectations for most of the other countries, and interest rates have fallen somewhat in other countries. Market participants now expect that interest rates will be raised in the US well into the latter half of this year and in the euro area in the beginning of 2005. In Sweden, the official interest rate was reduced by 0.25 percentage point in February. In Canada, the interest rate was cut by 0.25 percentage point in March. The recovery in the US and Asia has gained a firmer footing, while growth is sill very moderate in the euro area. Growth is high in the UK. The Swedish economy is rebounding, but unemployment has nevertheless increased. The Danish economy stagnated last year, and unemployment rose. Oil prices are high. In the beginning of March, oil prices rose to more than USD34 per barrel, which is the highest level recorded since the war in Iraq. Measured in euros, however, oil prices are lower than one year earlier. Low inflation in December, January and February contributed to a fall in interest rate expectations in Norway. Participants in financial and foreign exchange markets seem to expect that the sight deposit rate will move down to 1½ per cent, or slightly lower, in the period to summer. From autumn and in the coming years, the key interest rate is expected to rise gradually, broadly in tandem with the expected increase in interest rates among our trading partners. Activity in the Norwegian economy is picking up. Current statistics indicate firm growth in mainland output in the latter half of 2003. Private consumption is showing clear growth in line with expectations. On the other hand, business investment is sluggish. Sentiment surveys suggest growing optimism in the business sector. Employment increased in autumn of last year, but has remained virtually unchanged in recent months. Unemployment, as measured by Statistics Norway's labour force survey, was 4.6 per cent in December. Equity prices have advanced sharply in Norway. House price inflation is high, but there is excess capacity in the commercial property market. Growth in total credit to the household sector and mainland enterprises fell marginally to 5.4 per cent in November 2003. Growth in household debt is high, but did not increase in December and January. Credit demand is still not rising in the enterprise sector. Norges Bank's regional network reports that activity is rising in most industries, and that the market outlook is favourable for the next six months. Developments in output and demand are positive for manufacturing, construction, distributive trades and services. However, few enterprises are planning an increase in investment. Many enterprises report that they can increase production to a fairly large extent without a substantial growth in employment. According to information from our regional network, the decline in manufacturing employment seems to have come to a halt, however, and enterprises report a moderate increase in employment in the construction industry and distributive trades. The outlook and risk factors The analyses in Inflation Report 1/2004 are based on the assumption that the interest rate moves in line with forward interest rates observed at the beginning of March, i.e. a fall in the key interest rate towards 1½ per cent in the period to summer and thereafter a gradual increase. The krone exchange rate is assumed to follow forward exchange rates, which indicates that participants expect a fairly stable exchange rate ahead. Activity in the Norwegian economy is expected to pick up in the coming years. The past and ongoing rationalisation in the business sector may enable enterprises to increase production considerably in the short term without strong employment growth. This suggests that there is room for somewhat stronger growth in the economy without the emergence of pressures on real resources. Mainland GDP growth is projected to pick up markedly this year and remain relatively high in 2005 and 2006. The output level will be slightly higher than the trend level would imply. This means that the output gap, as estimated by Norges Bank, will be slightly negative this year and marginally positive in 2005 and 2006, and slightly negative this year. CPI-ATE inflation is projected to run somewhat below the inflation target next year. Two years ahead, there are prospects that inflation will move up to the inflation target of 2½ per cent. The Executive Board has assessed the following important risk factors that may lead to lower growth and inflation than projected:  Price developments for imported consumer goods are uncertain. Our projections are based on a gradual deceleration in the rate of decline of these prices measured in foreign currency. It is assumed that a large share of the gains associated with the shift in import patterns has been realised. Inflation among our trading partners may remain lower than projected in the period ahead. It is still uncertain how broad and sustainable the world economic recovery will be. The appreciation of the euro over the past six months may dampen the upturn in the euro area to a further extent than expected. The exchange rate has now reverted to the level prevailing before inflation started to decelerate. With the recent interest rate reductions, the Norwegian key interest rate is as low, as or lower than, the interest rate among trading partners. If interest rates continue to fall in other countries, the krone may appreciate. This will reduce the scope for reaching the inflation target. Several years of deteriorating competitiveness in Norwegian manufacturing has eroded profitability. If profitability in the manufacturing sector should be given greater weight in local and centralised wage negotiations than we have assumed, wage growth may turn out to be lower than projected. The unusually low rate of inflation may also push down wage growth. Intensified competition, with continued high productivity growth, may increase production capacity in the Norwegian economy to an even further extent and dampen inflation. There are also factors that suggest that growth and inflation may over time be higher than projected:  Monetary policy is now generating a fairly strong stimulus to the Norwegian economy. Our experience of such a considerable and rapid monetary policy easing is limited. It is possible we underestimate the effect of the stimulus on overall demand for goods and services. Labour shortages may emerge more rapidly than expected, which may lead to higher-than-projected wage growth. It cannot be ruled out that the krone depreciation since January 2003 may have a stronger and more rapid impact on inflation than assumed in the Inflation Report. AssessmentsAgainst the background of the above factors, the Executive Board has made the following assessments:  It may take time before interest rates in other countries are raised to a considerable extent. Past experience shows that in periods the krone is heavily influenced by developments in the interest rate differential between Norway and other countries. This is given weight in interest-rate setting. A period of too low inflation may influence inflation expectations among economic agents. Low inflation may therefore be self-reinforcing. Sharp increases in asset prices and debt accumulation may pose a risk to economic stability. However, it is only in the household sector where debt accumulation is high at present. There is little borrowing activity in the enterprise sector. Overall credit growth is in line with long-term growth in the economy. There is still a risk that total credit will show marked growth in the medium term. The aim of monetary policy is higher inflation. It is appropriate to be particularly vigilant with regard to developments in consumer prices, but consumer prices may show random variations from one month to the next. Later this year, we will receive confirmation of whether consumer prices are rising in line with our projections. When inflation increases from a very low level, this will provide a basis for gradually moving towards a more normal short-term interest rate level in Norway. This may counter excessive credit growth and excessive pressures on domestic resources in the medium term. Interest rate developments in other countries may also have a considerable impact on the krone and hence on Norwegian interest rates. Summary A path that is in line with the projections in Inflation Report 1/2004 provides a reasonable balance between the prospects for reaching the inflation target and stable developments in the real economy. As an alternative, the Executive Board has considered leaving the interest rate unchanged now and the possibility of keeping the interest rate low for a longer period. However, the Executive Board concluded that it is not appropriate - in the light of the decline in inflation - to deviate markedly from expectations in money and foreign exchange markets at present. The Executive Board has come to the conclusion that it is appropriate to reduce the key rate now by 0.25 percentage point. In reaching its decision, the Executive Board has weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations against the risk that output growth might eventually be too high. Furthermore, according to the Executive Board's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 1.75 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. Charts - monetary policy meeting(Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.) Charts - monetary policy meeting    Press release Norges Bank reduces interest rates Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to reduce the interest rate on banks' deposits with Norges Bank, the sight deposit rate, by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 per cent with effect from 29 January 2004. The interest rate on banks' overnight loans is being reduced correspondingly. According to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 2.00 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. The objective of monetary policyThe Government has defined an inflation target for monetary policy in Norway. The operational objective is a rise in consumer prices of 2½ per cent over time. In general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances are not taken into account. Norges Bank places particular emphasis on CPI inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) when assessing underlying inflation. Normally, Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to achieving an inflation rate of 2½ per cent two years ahead. It would in general have been possible to achieve the inflation target at a horizon shorter than two years by changing the interest rate more rapidly and more markedly. This might, however, have a greater impact on output and employment. Norges Bank has based its monetary policy on flexible inflation targeting, where variability in both output and inflation are given weight. Previous assessmentsOn 17 December 2003, Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to reduce the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.25 per cent. It was also stated that \"According to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 2.25 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher.\" In reaching its decision, the Executive Board weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations on the one hand against the risk that output growth might gradually become too strong on the other. In its last Inflation Report1, Norges Bank projected that growth in mainland GDP2 would pick up from ¾ per cent in 2003 to 3 per cent in 2004 and 2¾ per cent in 2005. The output gap, as calculated by Norges Bank, was expected to widen somewhat from marginally negative in 2003 to marginally positive this year and in 2005 and 2006. The mainland economy was thus expected to expand slightly more than trend. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was projected to increase to about 2¼ per cent in the summer of 2004 and to stabilise at target from autumn 2005. Recent developmentsParticular emphasis has been placed on the following new information since the previous monetary policy meeting: The year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE fell to 0.4 per cent in December. The rise in prices was lower than projected in the October Inflation Report. Overall inflation is still being pushed down by the fall in prices for imported consumer goods, by a low rise in prices for domestically produced consumer goods that are influenced by prices on the global market and by services such as air travel, and telecom and hotel services. The rise in prices for services with wages as a dominant cost factor remains high. After having depreciated last winter and spring up to summer 2003, the krone appreciated through the autumn. This trend was reversed after Norges Bank reduced the key rate in December. The import-weighted krone exchange rate (I-44) has since depreciated by about 4½ per cent. The short-term interest rate differential between Norway and its trading partners is now approximately zero. The rise in equity prices in other countries and in Norway, which began in March 2003, continued towards the end of 2003 and into 2004. Exchange rates between the major currencies have varied considerably since mid-December. The effective exchange rate for the euro has appreciated by about ½ per cent, while the effective exchange rate for the US dollar has depreciated by about 1¾ per cent. All in all, the dollar has now depreciated by about 25 per cent since the beginning of 2002. The European Central Bank left its key rate unchanged at 2 per cent at its January meeting. The Bank of Canada reduced its interest rate. The Bank of Japan decided to supply additional liquidity to the banking sector. Market expectations concerning key rates have been adjusted downwards in a number of countries. Market participants appear to expect the interest rate in Sweden to be reduced at the beginning of February. It is now expected that the Federal Reserve in the US and the ECB will keep interest rates low for a longer period and not increase interest rates until the autumn or towards the end of the year. Market pricing points to expectations of an increase in interest rates in the UK as early as the first quarter of 2004. Bond yields in the US and Germany have fallen since December. Short-term money market rates in Norway are expected to be somewhat lower than the average for our trading partners up to autumn 2004. Economic growth in the US has been somewhat stronger than projected in the October Inflation Report, but employment growth in December was unexpectedly sluggish. Growth is high in the UK. So far, output growth in Japan and the euro area seems to be approximately as projected in the Inflation Report. Sweden has recorded moderate economic growth, but employment has declined. In Denmark, growth in total ouput is weak. There are no signs that global consumer price inflation is rising. Since mid-January, oil prices have hovered around USD 32 per barrel, the highest level since the outbreak of the war in Iraq. High oil prices partly reflect higher demand for oil in the US, where crude oil stocks fell to their lowest level in 28 years. Measured in euros, however, the price of oil is lower than one year earlier. In Norway, household consumption of goods was somewhat lower than expected in November. Traditional merchandise imports fell slightly in the fourth quarter. The decline was most pronounced for capital goods. After having fallen in the first half of the year, house prices rose through the autumn of 2003. On the other hand, prices in the commercial property market are influenced by the large number of vacant premises. Growth in total credit to households and the mainland business sector remains stable at about 6 per cent. Growth in household debt is edging up, while enterprises are not increasing their demand for credit. The number of persons employed has increased since May 2003. The number of man-weeks worked continued to fall until last summer, but the decline levelled off last autumn. Unemployment has been approximately unchanged in recent months. The outlook and risk factorsThe Executive Board has assessed the outlook and the following important risk factors: The depreciation of the krone in 2003 and into 2004 has not yet been reflected in consumer prices, but a higher rise in prices for imported consumer goods is expected to push up consumer price inflation over the next six months. The decline in prices for imported goods in recent months may indicate that the pass-through from the exchange rate to consumer prices takes longer than assumed earlier. The fall in prices may also be due to more pronounced shifts in trade patterns and weaker than assumed price developments, measured in foreign currency, for imported goods. As discussed in Inflation Report 3/03, it may take longer for inflation to pick up if productivity growth is stronger than assumed by Norges Bank. Changes in the competitive situation in retail trade and the service sector may influence productivity developments and prices to a greater extent than assumed earlier. The Inflation Report was based on the assumption that wage growth is primarily determined by overall conditions in the labour market. The increase in the number employed, which is somewhat higher than assumed earlier, may, in isolation, contribute to pushing up wage growth. It is conceivable, however, that profitability in internationally exposed industries will again play a more prominent role. Overall wage growth may then be lower than projected. The prospect of low inflation this year may also contribute to curbing wage growth. The year-on-year rise in the overall consumer price index fell from 1.4 per cent in November to 0.6 per cent in December. Developments in European economies have a stronger impact on output and employment in Norway than developments in the US economy. The appreciation of the euro may curb the moderate growth in continental Europe. This may contribute to extending the period of low interest rates in the euro area. Low interest rates in Norway may provide the basis for a rise in household debt and house prices which might have a negative impact on financial stability in the long term. On the other hand, growth in corporate demand for credit is very low, and at the moment there are few signs of increased investment activity in the business sector. AssessmentsAgainst the background of the above factors, the Executive Board has made the following assessments: The aim of monetary policy is higher inflation. After a period of very low inflation as we have now witnessed, it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant in monetary policy when inflation does not increase as expected. The consumer price figure for December indicates that the unexpectedly low rise in prices in November was not incidental. Driven by interest rate expectations, the exchange rate for the Norwegian krone has depreciated since the last monetary policy meeting and has contributed, in isolation, to a more expansionary monetary policy. As with the exchange rates for the major currencies, the krone exchange rate has varied considerably since mid-December. Output in the mainland economy appears to be picking up approximately as expected. Private consumption and high petroleum investment are the most important driving forces. At the same time, the business sector is still feeling the effects of the very sharp rise in labour costs over several years. The cost level may hamper growth in output and employment. Growth in total credit (domestic and foreign sources) has remained stable since last summer. Overall, the outlook for financial stability is considered to be satisfactory. The depreciation of the Norwegian krone has also strengthened the financial position of enterprises, but the current low level of interest rates may also increase the risk of a continued sharp rise in household debt and house prices. Conclusion The Executive Board has come to the conclusion that it is appropriate to reduce the key rate now by 0.25 percentage point. In reaching its decision, the Executive Board has weighed the objective of bringing inflation back to target and stabilising inflation expectations on the one hand against the risk that output growth may gradually become too strong on the other. Furthermore, according to Norges Bank's assessment, with a sight deposit rate of 2 per cent at present, the probability that inflation two years ahead will be lower than 2½ per cent is greater than the probability that it will be higher. Footnotes 1 Inflation Report 3/03 from October 2003 2 Excluding the effect of the fall in electricity production    Press release Norges Bank keeps the interest rate unchanged Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave the interest rate unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 2.25 per cent. The overnight lending rate was also left unchanged. Since summer, monetary policy has been oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps - towards a more normal level. Growth in demand and output is still high and may in isolation suggest a more rapid increase in the interest rate. This would reduce the risk of bottlenecks in the economy, with rising cost inflation and continued debt build-up. On the other hand, raising the interest rate more rapidly would increase the risk of a renewed appreciation of the krone. This could counter an increase in inflation towards the target of 2.5 per cent. Developments in output, demand and inflation do not differ substantially from the projections in Inflation Report 3/05. In the Inflation Report, the Executive Board's assessment was that the sight deposit rate should lie in the interval 2-3 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 16 March 2006, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with the projections. There are prospects that the interest rate will increase further, in small, not too frequent steps. Outlook and risk factors The projections in Inflation Report 3/05 were based on a gradual increase in the interest rate towards a more normal level. Inflation as measured by the CPI-ATE was projected to rise gradually and reach the target of 2.5 per cent in 2008. Mainland output is now above its normal level. The output gap, which is a measure of capacity utilisation in the economy, was projected to increase further in 2006. A monetary policy stance that gradually becomes less expansionary will stabilise the economy over time, thereby curbing the rise in inflation and preventing it from overshooting the target. The Inflation Report pointed to the risk that a low interest rate over a long period may result in strong pressures in the economy. It also referred to the possibility that continued trade shifts and increased labour market competition might result in lower price and wage inflation and weaker pressures in the economy. The Report stressed global economic uncertainty, and stated that different developments in global growth and in oil prices might result in a different path for the Norwegian economy than projected. Imported price inflation has been slightly lower than expected, and oil prices have fluctuated since the Report was published. At the same time, the krone is somewhat weaker than assumed, and there are prospects that the interest rate level will rise among a number of our trading partners. Neither these factors nor other information provide grounds for changing the assessment of the outlook or risk factors. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 2 November: GDP figures for the third quarter confirm that the global economy is continuing to expand. GDP growth in the US picked up in the third quarter, largely due to private consumption, although investment growth is also high. Economic growth appears to remain buoyant in the fourth quarter. In the euro area, growth has picked up somewhat. Both exports and investment have shown an increase. Activity in Sweden has also picked up after a slight drop at the beginning of the year. In Japan, the recovery seems to have taken hold. In the UK, economic growth is still moderate. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices has declined somewhat in the US, the euro area, the UK and Japan. Consumer price inflation is nevertheless still high in the US and slightly above target in the euro area and the UK. The European Central Bank (ECB) raised its key rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.25 per cent with effect from 6 December. The ECB gave weight to rising inflation and the risk of high inflation expectations. The Federal Reserve raised its key rate by 0.25 percentage point on 13 December. Market participants are expecting interest rate increases in the course of the next three months in the US, the euro area, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, New Zealand and Switzerland. In the UK, the key rate is expected to remain unchanged in the year ahead. Oil prices have fluctuated somewhat but have now reverted to about the same level as at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting, around USD 59 per barrel. Long-term oil futures have risen slightly. Equity markets in for example the US, Japan, the euro area, the UK and Sweden have risen. The benchmark index on the Oslo Stock Exchange has risen by 11 per cent since the beginning of November. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was 1.1 per cent in November, down from 1.2 per cent in October. Adjusted for the interest rate's direct effect on house rents, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE is estimated at 1.2 per cent in November. The rise in the overall consumer price index (CPI) was 1.8 per cent in November. The rise in prices in October and November was approximately as expected. According to a survey conducted by TNS Gallup, inflation expectations have increased somewhat since September. Inflation expectations have increased slightly for all groups in the survey, both with regard to the coming year and further ahead. Following a gradual appreciation through most of the year, the import-weighted krone exchange rate (I-44) has depreciated since the previous monetary policy meeting. Financial market participants expect a gradual rise in Norges Bank's key rate ahead. There has been little change in interest rate expectations since the last monetary policy meeting. National accounts figures for the third quarter show moderate employment growth. Reports from Norges Bank's regional network in October/November present a somewhat stronger picture of the labour market and suggest continued employment growth in most industries. The impression of a tighter labour market is confirmed by Labour Directorate figures, which show that unemployment has fallen further. The number of registered vacancies has increased. Consumer spending on goods has been more subdued than expected. National accounts figures showed nevertheless that growth in total private consumption was solid in the third quarter. TNS Gallup's consumer confidence indicator declined somewhat from August to November, but is still high. The decline is due to lower expectations with regard to domestic economic developments. Households are still highly optimistic with regard to their personal finances. Twelve-month growth in credit to households from domestic sources (C2) rose to 13.0 per cent in October. The rise in house prices is still high. Housing investment and housing starts have been more subdued in the past few months. Preliminary national accounts figures showed that mainland GDP increased by 0.8 per cent from the second to the third quarter, approximately as expected. Growth was primarily driven by commercial services, retail trade and financial services. In TNS Gallup's fourth quarter business sentiment survey, business leaders continue to report improved profitability. After rising for several quarters, manufacturing output declined somewhat in the period August to October, although order backlogs are still increasing. New orders in the construction industry are also showing solid growth. Debt accumulation in the enterprise sector rose in October. Estimates for investment in oil and gas recovery in 2006 were adjusted upwards in the latest survey. Information from Norges Bank's regional network indicates solid growth in all industries. Compared with August/September, growth was reported to be stronger in the export industry and corporate services, but somewhat weaker in retail trade and the household service sector. Labour shortages have been reported in the construction industry, oil-related industries and in a number of service industries. Information from the regional network indicates that capacity utilisation in the economy is now higher than in the first half of 2005. Nominal growth in central government spending is estimated at 4¾ per cent in 2005 after extra allocations in the final central government budget bill. The approved central government budget for 2006 entails a balanced amendment to the budget in relation to the budget proposed by the previous government. Nominal underlying spending growth is estimated at 4½ per cent. No substantial amounts have been set aside to meet unforeseen expenditure besides wage settlement provisions.  Charts - monetary policy meeting (648 Kb) (Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting (125 Kb)     Press release Norges Bank increases the interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.25 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to raise the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.25 per cent with effect from 3 November 2005. The interest rate on banks' overnight loans is also being raised by 0.25 percentage point. Output growth is high and may in isolation suggest a more rapid increase in the interest rate ahead. This would reduce the risk of bottlenecks in the economy with rising cost inflation and continued debt build-up. On the other hand, raising the interest rate more rapidly would increase the risk of a stronger krone, which could counter an increase in inflation towards the target of 2.5 per cent. Interest-rate setting since this spring has been oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps - towards a more normal level. On the basis of the analysis in the Inflation Report, this strategy still appears to provide a reasonable balance between the objectives of monetary policy that are to be safeguarded by Norges Bank. The monetary policy strategy in Inflation Report 3/05 is that the sight deposit rate should lie in the interval 2-3 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 16 March 2006, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with the projections. Outlook and risk factors The projections in Inflation Report 3/05 are based on an interest rate path that in the view of the Executive Board provides a reasonable balance between the objectives of monetary policy. The projections imply a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps - towards a more normal level. In the analysis, it is assumed that money market rates among our trading partners also increase gradually over the next three years. Exchange rate movements are difficult to project. The interest rate path in Norway and abroad may be consistent with an approximately unchanged krone exchange rate. With this interest rate path, CPI-ATE inflation is projected to increase gradually from about 1½ per cent today to close to 2 per cent at the beginning of 2007. Inflation is likely to increase further and reach the target of 2½ per cent in 2008. Continued low interest rates will probably contribute to above-trend output growth again in 2006. The output gap, which is a measure of capacity utilisation in the economy, is estimated to be positive this year and increase further in 2006. A gradual increase in the interest rate towards a more normal level will probably result in lower growth in demand for goods and services after a period. Capacity utilisation may in time be brought down somewhat from a high level and stabilised. This will curb the rise in inflation, so that it stabilises close to target. The Executive Board would place particular emphasis on the following factors of uncertainty: Stronger trade shifts and increased labour market competition may result in lower price and wage inflation and weaker pressures in the economy. This would then imply, in isolation, less frequent interest rate changes. We have little experience of such low interest rates over a long period. There is a risk that an interest rate that is kept low for a longer period may lead to expectations of a persistently low interest rate. This may result in a higher-than-projected rise in output and inflation and would in isolation suggest a faster interest rate increase. Developments in the global economy are uncertain. Our projections are partly based on favourable growth prospects for other countries and continued high oil prices. Alternative developments for international growth and oil prices may result in a path for the Norwegian economy that differs from the one projected. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed particular emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting: Output growth remains buoyant in the US and appears to be increasing somewhat in Sweden. In the euro area, there are still few signs of a pick-up in domestic demand. Various confidence indicators nevertheless suggest growing optimism in enterprises, as is the case in Germany. Activity seems to be slowing more than expected in the UK. Growth in most newly industrialised countries in Asia remains strong. In Japan, it appears that developments were weak in the third quarter, but there are expectations that private demand will pick up ahead. There are clear signs that consumer prices are increasing more rapidly in the US, the UK and to a certain extent in the euro area. So far, high energy prices have had little impact on other consumer prices. The central banks in the US, Canada and New Zealand have all increased their key rates by 0.25 percentage point since our previous monetary policy meeting. Market interest rate expectations have risen in a number of countries. An increase in the interest rate is expected in the course of the next three months in the US, Canada, the euro area, Switzerland and New Zealand. International long-term interest rates have increased. Equity prices have remained high in Europe and the US, but have fallen in Japan. Both oil spot prices and oil futures 6-7 years ahead have fallen somewhat, but remain at a high level. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was 1.3 per cent in September. Adjusted for the direct impact of interest rates, which have pushed down house rents, inflation was 1.5 per cent. Adjusted for tax changes alone, inflation (CPI-AT) was 1.7 per cent. The rise in the overall consumer price index (CPI) was 2 per cent. As measured by the import-weighted exchange rate index I-44, the krone exchange rate is now at approximately the level prevailing at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. Market interest rate expectations have risen somewhat since the previous monetary policy meeting. Interest rates in Norway are expected to be higher than for an average of our trading partners from the beginning of 2006, although the interest rate differential is not expected to be particularly wide. Long-term Norwegian interest rates have risen. The benchmark index on the Oslo Stock Exchange has fallen markedly since the beginning of October, with equities in the energy sector showing the sharpest decline. Statistics Norway's Labour Force Survey shows that employment growth has edged up in recent months. The contacts in Norges Bank's regional network reported growth in employment in the business sector in August and September. A larger share of contacts in our regional network are considering recruiting new employees and fewer are considering reducing their workforces. Unemployment, as registered by the Directorate of Labour, is still falling. Manufacturing production and new commercial building starts are still on the rise. Statistics Norway's business tendency survey for the third quarter indicates that growth in output and capacity utilisation in manufacturing will continue in the fourth quarter. Total debt for mainland enterprises has increased. These enterprises' liquidity holdings in the form of bank deposits were 18.4 per cent higher in September than one year earlier. Household consumption of goods fell in September. At the same time, debt accumulation is rising. As a percentage of disposable income, household net assets showed a slight rise in the second quarter. House price inflation has stabilised at a high level in recent months. Housing starts appear to be moderating. Information from Norges Bank's regional network indicates continued growth in demand and production in all industries. With the exception of the construction industry, where activity is already high, growth is expected to be at about the same level over the next six months. There are signs of some skills shortages in construction, manufacturing and some service sectors. The former government's budget proposal for 2006 estimates the structural, non-oil deficit for 2006 at NOK 66 billion, which is NOK 2½ billion higher than in 2005. Underlying nominal spending growth is estimated at 3.7 per cent. Local government revenues are estimated to show a nominal rise of 3½ per cent in 2006. The new government has indicated that public spending growth will be higher than proposed by the former government and will be financed by higher direct and indirect taxes.  Charts - monetary policy meeting (655 Kb) (Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting (162 Kb)     Press release Norges Bank keeps the interest rate unchanged at 2.00 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave the interest rate unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 2.00 per cent. The overnight lending rate was also left unchanged. The objectives of bringing inflation back to the target of 2.5 per cent and anchoring inflation expectations imply a continued low interest rate. The krone has appreciated since the previous monetary policy meeting. On the other hand, there are expectations that high output growth will persist. The objective of stabilising developments in output may, in isolation, imply a higher interest rate. Inflation is gradually picking up. High capacity utilisation may generate a continued sharp rise in property prices and household borrowing. This could be a source of instability in demand and output in the somewhat longer run. The Executive Board's assessment in the June 2005 Inflation Report was that the interest rate may gradually - in small, not too frequent steps - be brought up towards a more normal level if economic developments are approximately as projected in the Report. This was considered to provide a reasonable balance between the objective of stabilising inflation at target and the objective of stabilising growth in output and employment. It was the Executive Board's assessment that the sight deposit rate should lie in the interval 1¾ - 2¾ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 2 November. Developments in output, demand and underlying inflation have been consistent with the projections in the June Inflation Report. The Executive Board's monetary policy strategy and assessments indicate that the interest rate should be gradually increased ahead. One option was to increase the interest rate at this meeting, but we found it appropriate to leave the interest rate unchanged. Outlook and risk factors The analyses in the June 2005 Inflation Report showed that capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is expected to increase this year and next, and to exceed its normal level. There are prospects that inflation will gradually pick up and be close to 2½ per cent at the three-year horizon. Since the June Inflation Report, prices for domestically produced consumer goods have risen less sharply than expected. At the same time, oil prices have been somewhat higher than assumed. Energy prices are pushing up consumer price inflation. New information since the previous Inflation Report does not provide grounds for changing the assessment of developments in the real economy. Growth among trading partners seems on the whole to be approximately as expected in the June Inflation Report. High oil prices may result in somewhat higher global inflation than previously projected. The June Inflation Report pointed to the risk that a low interest rate over a long period may gradually result in stronger pressures in the economy than indicated in the baseline scenario. The Report also pointed to the possibility that the price-curbing effects of intensified competition and increased imports from low-cost countries in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe may continue to restrain inflation. High activity in these countries has pushed up demand for commodities. This has resulted in high energy prices. The year-on-year rise in consumer price inflation adjusted for tax changes and the direct effect of interest rates on house rents was 1.7 per cent in August. So far, imported price inflation has fluctuated somewhat, but neither these figures nor other information provide grounds for changing the assessment of the uncertain factors. Economic developments The Executive Board also places particular emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 11 August: While current indicators for the US economy released in June-July mainly gave a positive impression, the picture has been more mixed recently. Retail sales have increased, but industrial output is showing sluggish developments. In isolation, the physical damage resulting from Hurricane Katrina will probably not have a long-term effect on the US economy. Some production capacity will be out of operation for a period, although reconstruction will boost demand fairly quickly. Industrial output has also shown weak developments in the euro area. In the UK, growth in GDP has slowed. In Japan, GDP figures for the second quarter reflected positive contributions from both private consumption and private investment. In Sweden, indicators for both the corporate and household sectors show more positive developments. The Federal Reserve raised its key rate by 0.25 percentage point on 20 September. Market participants expect a continued rise in interest rates in the US. In the UK, market participants consider it likely that the interest rate will be lowered at the beginning of 2006. The first increase in the interest rate in Sweden is expected in spring 2006. Interest rate expectations have fallen in the euro area, and the key rate is now expected to be left unchanged for a longer period. The price of oil has remained high and has at times exceeded USD 65 per barrel. Developments in oil and petrol prices have been affected by Hurricane Katrina and the risk of additional hurricanes. Consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) fell by 0.1 per cent from July to August. The year-on-year rise was 1.3 per cent in August, up from 1.1 per cent in June and July. Adjusted for the interest rate's direct effect on house rents, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE is estimated at 1.5 per cent in August. The CPI rose by 1.9 per cent in the same period, which was more than expected. Measured by the import-weighted krone exchange rate, the krone has appreciated somewhat since the previous monetary policy meeting. Financial market participants expect a gradual rise in Norges Bank's key rate ahead. Forward rates are virtually unchanged since the June Inflation Report. Directorate of Labour figures show that seasonally-adjusted unemployment stood at 3.4 per cent in August, down by 0.1 percentage point from the previous month. Developments in registered employment are in line with the projections in the June Inflation Report. Statistics Norway's Labour Force Survey (LFS) presents a somewhat weaker picture of unemployment. According to quarterly national accounts figures, employment rose by 0.5 per cent from the first half of last year to the same period this year. Measured by the LFS, employment increased markedly in June, with the number of employed persons rising by 12 000 compared with May. This is approximately in line with the projection in the June Inflation Report. Household goods consumption rose somewhat from June to July. National accounts figures for the second quarter showed a sharp increase in private consumption. TNS Gallup's consumer confidence indicator picked up from May to August. Households are optimistic about their own finances and the national economy, and expectations with regard to the economy next year have become more positive. Growth in household credit has picked up. The rise in house prices has slowed somewhat, but remains strong. Housing starts picked up in July. Preliminary national accounts figures showed that mainland GDP increased by 0.9 per cent from the first to the second quarter. Growth was primarily fuelled by the construction industry, financial services and retail trade. Developments were consistent with the projections in the June Inflation Report. Manufacturing output increased from May to July. Growth was high in all product groups. The investment intentions survey for oil and gas production shows that the estimates for 2006 have been adjusted upwards since the previous quarter, while the estimates for 2005 have been revised downwards. According to TNS Gallup's third quarter business sentiment survey, industrial leaders still consider profitability to be very good. The rate of growth in overall debt for mainland enterprises has picked up somewhat. The twelve-month rise in corporate liquidity in the form of bank deposits moved up in July.

Charts - monetary policy meeting  (PDF, 116 kB)    Press release Norges Bank increases the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 3.50 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to raise its key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 3.50 per cent with effect from 14 December 2006. New information since the beginning of November has been broadly in line with the projections in Inflation Report 3/06. Employment is rising rapidly and unemployment has fallen markedly. A steadily rising number of enterprises are facing labour shortages. Wage growth appears to be on the rise. Underlying inflation has been somewhat higher than expected over the past three months and is now estimated to lie in the interval 1-1¾ per cent. The krone exchange rate is somewhat stronger than assumed. Monetary policy influences the economy with a lag. Over several years, interest rates have been considerably lower than what we consider to be a neutral level. The interest rate may gradually be raised to a more normal level, although it is unlikely that rates will be raised at every monetary policy meeting. The interest rate will thus continue to be raised in small, not too frequent steps. According to the monetary policy strategy in Inflation Report 3/06, the sight deposit rate should be in the interval 3¼ - 4¼ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 15 March, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. On balance, the strategy in Inflation Report 3/06 and new information point to an interest rate increase at this meeting. Outlook and risk factors The analyses in Inflation Report 3/06 suggest that the interest rate may gradually be raised to a more normal level, although it is unlikely that rates will be raised at every monetary policy meeting. In the report, growth in the world economy is expected to hold up even with slower growth in the US. In Norway, capacity utilisation is projected to increase further. A continued moderate rise in labour costs this year, strong competition in product markets, high productivity growth and an increase in the share of imports from low-cost countries will probably contribute to keeping consumer price inflation at a low level through the remainder of this year and into next year. Against the background of high capacity utilisation, rising wage growth and somewhat lower productivity growth, inflation is expected to pick up in Norway, in particular from the latter half of 2007 and into 2008. In the previous Inflation Report, it was pointed out that on the one hand pronounced trade shifts, increased competition, weaker global growth or a strong krone may result in low inflation. The low level of real interest rates prevailing in recent years or a depreciation of the krone may on the other hand lead to higher-than-projected growth in output and inflation. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information, which has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 1 November: Developments in the world economy have been broadly in line with the projections in the latest Inflation Report. There are prospects that economic growth will slow in the US, but that growth will hold up in Europe and Asia. On the whole, global equity prices have shown little change since the strong gains observed earlier in autumn. Brent Blend spot prices have risen to a little less than USD 65 per barrel, but are still lower than in summer. Futures prices for delivery at end-2008 remain unchanged just below USD 68 per barrel. Other commodity prices have edged up. The fall in energy prices through autumn has pushed down consumer price inflation in many countries. Core inflation has been more stable and remains moderate in most countries. In the US, core inflation fell in October, after rising for a longer period. Since the previous monetary policy meeting, policy rates have been raised by 0.25 percentage point in the euro area, the UK and Australia. Interest rate expectations 12 months ahead remain virtually unchanged in the euro area, US and UK. In Sweden, there are expectations of a slightly faster increase in interest rates. In the year ahead, market participants expect an increase in policy rates in the euro area, Sweden, Switzerland and Japan. In the same period, policy rates are expected to be lowered in the US and Canada. International bond yields with long maturities are low and have shown little change. In Norway, money market rates are now expected to rise somewhat faster than implied by market expectations prior to the publication of the previous Inflation Report. Prices in financial markets indicate that there are expectations that the key policy rate in Norway will increase by 1.25-1.50 percentage point over the next twelve months. The import-weighted krone exchange rate (I-44) has appreciated by a little more than 3 per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting and is now about 2¼ per cent stronger than the level that was assumed to prevail at the beginning of 2007 in the previous Inflation Report. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index (CPI) was 2.6 per cent in November. The recent fall in electricity prices will probably lead to a somewhat slower rate of increase in the CPI through winter than projected in the latest Inflation Report. Various measures of underlying inflation have edged up over the past three months. In November, the year-on-year rise in the consumer price index adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was 0.8 per cent, and 1.0 per cent when further adjusted for lower maximum day-care rates. The rate of increase measured by a trimmed mean of sub-indices in the consumer prices index was 1.7 per cent in November. As measured by the weighted median, the rate of increase was 2.3 per cent. TNS Gallup's expectations survey for the fourth quarter of 2006 point to stable inflation expectations. Economists in the financial industry and academia expect inflation to be close to the inflation target 2 and 5 years ahead. According to Statistics Norway's wage index, growth in disbursed wages picked up in the third quarter, particularly in retail trade and the transport industry. High bonus payments are pushing up wage growth in the financial industry. TNS Gallup's survey indicates that expectations concerning wage growth in 2006 and 2007 have increased somewhat. According to Statistics Norway, mainland GDP increased by 0.9 per cent in third quarter and 4.6 per cent in the first three quarters of this year compared with the same period one year earlier. Mainland GDP growth in 2005 has been revised up from 3.7 per cent to 4.1 per cent. Both Statistics Norway's labour force survey (LFS) and preliminary national accounts figures show strong employment growth in the third quarter. According to the LFS, the labour force showed a further increase. Unemployment still continued to fall and seasonally adjusted LFS unemployment moved down to 3.3 per cent. Adjusted for normal seasonal variations, the number of registered unemployed came to 2.2 per cent of the labour force in November. In manufacturing, growth in total production and new orders remains firm. According to Statistics Norway's investment intentions survey for the fourth quarter of 2006, investment plans for this year and next have been revised up somewhat in manufacturing, the power supply industry and petroleum sector. Total gross debt of mainland enterprises is still on the rise and was 16.9 per cent higher in August 2006 than in August 2005. Money growth in the enterprise sector remains high. The benchmark index on the Oslo Stock Exchange has increased. Household spending on goods continued to rise in October, with twelve-month growth at 5.7 per cent. TNS Gallup's trend indicator, which measures households' assessments and expectations concerning their financial situation and the Norwegian economy, is at a high level. Growth in household debt remains high. The twelve-month rate of increase in house prices edged down to 18.0 per cent in November, according to house prices statistics from the real estate industry. Housing starts are higher so far this year compared with the same period one year earlier, but new orders fell between the second and third quarter. Information from Norges Bank's regional network in November 2006 indicates that the Norwegian economy is still booming. Growth in manufacturing is somewhat stronger than at the time of the previous regional report in August. Enterprises expect slower growth over the next half-year as a result of capacity constraints. All industries report steadily growing difficulties in procuring skilled labour. Our contacts in the regional network have revised up their wage growth expectations for 2006 to some extent. Selling prices will rise at a faster pace in manufacturing and the building industry. The rise in prices is lower and more stable in retail trade and household services. The Storting (Norwegian parliament) has approved the general budget for 2007. The structural, non-oil budget deficit is estimated at NOK 71 billion, i.e. 4.6 per cent of trend GDP for mainland Norway or an increase of 0.3 percentage point on this year. Underlying nominal spending growth is estimated at 6.7 per cent, compared with 5.2 per cent this year.  Charts - monetary policy meeting (1 048 kB) (Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting (153 kB)     Press release Norges Bank increases the interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to 3.25 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to raise the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 3.25 per cent with effect from 2 November 2006. The interest rate on banks' overnight loans is also being raised by 0.25 percentage point. Underlying inflation has been lower than projected in recent months. Nevertheless, several factors point to higher inflation ahead. Capacity utilisation is high and there is little spare capacity in the Norwegian economy. Employment is rising rapidly and unemployment has exhibited a marked decline. There are signs of higher wage growth and expectations of rising inflation. At the same time, the krone exchange rate has depreciated from strong values. Monetary policy influences the economy with a lag. Over several years, interest rates have been considerably lower than what we consider to be a neutral level. Against the background of high growth in output and employment, rising wage growth and a weaker krone, there are prospects of higher consumer price inflation ahead. The interest rate may gradually be raised to a more normal level at a somewhat faster pace than envisaged earlier, although it is unlikely that rates will be raised at every monetary policy meeting. Based on our current assessment, the interest rate will thus continue to be raised in small, not too frequent steps. According to the monetary policy strategy in Inflation Report 3/06, the sight deposit rate should be in the interval 3¼ - 4¼% in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 15 March, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. Outlook and risk factorsAfter expanding at a strong pace over several years, the US economy is now showing signs of a slowdown. This may have ripple effects in other countries. It still seems that growth in the world economy will be sustained. The weight of China, India and other Asian economies in the world economy is rising. In the euro area, and to some extent in Japan, the upturn has broadened, and dependence on the US economy has been reduced somewhat. \r",
      " Mainland GDP growth in Norway will probably be high again in 2007. Capacity utilisation will continue to rise and the labour market will become tighter. High capacity utilisation, rising wage growth and somewhat slower productivity growth are expected to lead to higher inflation, particularly from the second half of 2007 and into 2008. Compared with the previous Inflation Report, inflation is now expected to increase at a somewhat later point in time. Continued moderate growth in labour costs this year, strong competition in product markets, high productivity growth and an increase in the share of imports from low-cost countries will probably contribute to keeping consumer price inflation at a low level to the end of the year and into next year. New information may reveal aspects of economic developments that indicate that the Norwegian economy is moving on a different path than projected. On the one hand, major shifts in trade patterns, strong competition, weaker global growth or a stronger krone exchange rate may result in low inflation. On the other hand, low real interest rates or a further depreciation of the krone may lead to a higher-than-projected rise in output and inflation. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information, which has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 27 September: \r",
      " Growth in the world economy remains high, but growth in the US is softening. The fall in energy prices in recent months is restraining the rise in producer and consumer prices. Core inflation in the US increased in August and September, but is still moderate in other countries. The policy rate has been raised by 0.25 percentage point in the euro area and Sweden, to 3.25% and 2.75% respectively. After falling through summer, long-term interest rates have increased internationally. Short-term interest rates have also moved up. Market participants expect an interest rate cut in the US in the course of summer 2007. Market interest rates in Norway have increased slightly more than external interest rates. After falling sharply in recent months, crude oil prices have shown little change since the previous monetary policy meeting in spite of OPEC's decision to cut production. Oil prices are now about USD 56 per barrel. Oil futures prices in 2008 have increased somewhat, to about USD 67 per barrel. Overall, non-oil commodity prices have also increased. Global equity markets have advanced. The benchmark index on the Oslo Stock Exchange has increased by 8 per cent. The import-weighted krone exchange rate (I-44) depreciated in the beginning of October, but has appreciated again thereafter. The krone exchange rate is now close to the level prevailing at the previous monetary policy meeting. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices (CPI) moved up by 0.7 percentage point to 2.6 per cent from August to September. Consumer price inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was 0.5 per cent. Adjusted for the direct effect of interest rates on house rents and the effect of lower maximum day-care rates, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 0.8 per cent. In the same period, inflation measured by a weighted median was 1.6 per cent, while it was 1.3 per cent measured by a trimmed mean. According to foreign trade statistics for the third quarter, export prices are still rising at a fast pace. The rise in prices for imported intermediate and consumer goods has picked up. According to figures from the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Organisation, seasonally adjusted registered unemployment showed a further decline from August to September to 2.4 per cent of the labour force. According to Statistics Norway's labour force survey, seasonally adjusted unemployment was 3.4 per cent of the labour force in the period June-August, i.e. a decline of 13 000 persons on the previous three-month period. In the same period, employment rose by a seasonally adjusted 20 000 persons. Growth in total manufacturing production is holding up. According to Statistics Norway's business tendency survey for the third quarter, capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector is high and production is expected to show further growth in the final quarter of this year. Building activity is still buoyant. Mainland enterprises are steadily accumulating more debt. The twelve-month rate of growth in their domestic debt (C2) has increased, and stood at 21.7 per cent in September. Money growth in the enterprise sector is still rising at a fast rate. Household spending on goods rose in August and September. According to the real estate industry's house price statistics, the year-on-year rise in house prices was 17.8 per cent in September. Statistics Norway's house price index for the third quarter showed a rise of 14.5 per cent on the same quarter one year earlier. High debt growth and lower investment in financial assets have contributed to a fall in household net lending over the four quarters to the second quarter of 2006. The rate of household debt accumulation was also high in the third quarter. Local government finances have improved, primarily as a result of strong growth in tax revenues. In the four quarters to the second quarter of 2006, local government net lending is estimated at NOK 3bn. In the Government's budget proposal for 2007, the structural, non-oil deficit for 2007 is estimated at NOK 71bn, i.e. an increase of NOK 8.2bn on 2006. Petroleum revenue spending is estimated at about 4.0 per cent of the capital in the Government Pension Fund - Global. Underlying nominal growth in government spending is estimated at 6.4 per cent. Strong growth in the Norwegian economy is boosting tax revenues and reducing spending on unemployment benefits. As a result, the general government budget deficit excluding transfers from the Government Pension Fund - Global will be reduced from 2006 to 2007. These automatic stabilisers are also dampening cyclical fluctuations.

Charts - monetary policy meeting (792 kB)     Press release Norges Bank keeps the interest rate unchanged Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave the interest rate unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, thus remains at 3.00 per cent. The overnight lending rate was also left unchanged. There is now little slack in the Norwegian economy. A steadily rising share of enterprises lack the capacity to accommodate increased demand, largely because of labour shortages. The labour market has grown considerably tighter, and there are several signs that wage growth is picking up. Developments in aggregate demand, output and employment suggest a higher interest rate. At the same time, the rise in consumer prices is slowing, and the rise in prices excluding energy products is unexpectedly low. This suggests a continued low interest rate. According to the monetary policy strategy in Inflation Report 2/06, the sight deposit rate should be in the interval 2¾ - 3¾ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 1 November, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. Monetary policy is oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps - towards a more normal level. The strategy published in the Inflation Report, coupled with new information, implies that the interest rate should be kept unchanged at the present meeting. Continued high capacity utilisation and growth are likely to result in a gradual pick-up in inflation. The interest rate will therefore be set so that monetary policy gradually becomes less expansionary. Outlook and risk factorsThe analyses in Inflation Report 2/06 were based on a gradual increase in the interest rate towards a more normal level. In the first six months of 2006, the key rate was increased in two increments of 0.25 percentage point. There were prospects that the interest rate would rise further at about the same pace. In Inflation Report 2/06, inflation is projected to pick up gradually, bringing it close to the target of 2.5 per cent three years ahead. The gradual increase in the interest rate will curb growth in demand for goods and services, credit growth and house price inflation. \r",
      " The Inflation Report indicated that continued pronounced shifts in the import pattern, a strong krone exchange rate and keen domestic competition may result in lower-than-expected inflation. The Report also pointed out that a long period of low real interest rates may result in more rapid output and employment growth and higher-than-projected price and cost inflation. New information since the Inflation Report was published provides mixed signals. The rise in prices has slowed. CPI inflation is approximately as expected, but it is lower than projected when excluding energy products. Strong competition and high productivity growth, coupled with fairly low wage growth, have contributed for a long period to holding down the rise in prices for Norwegian goods and services. New data indicate that pressures in the Norwegian economy are now building up more rapidly than expected. At the same time, the krone has depreciated from high values. Economic developmentsThe Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information, which has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 16 August: \r",
      " Growth in the Norwegian economy is high. Preliminary national accounts figures show that mainland GDP was 3.8 per cent higher in the first half of 2006 than in the first half of 2005. Growth was primarily fuelled by exports and private consumption. Employment is rising sharply. According to national accounts figures, the number of employed and the number of person-hours worked increased by 2.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, from the first half of last year to the first half of 2006. According to Statistics Norway's Labour Force Survey (LFS), the seasonally adjusted number employed was 17 000 higher in the period May-July than in the previous three-month period. Unemployment has fallen markedly. According to the LFS, seasonally adjusted unemployment was 3.2 per cent in the period from May to July, a decline of 0.3 per cent on the previous three-month period. Registered unemployment fell further in August, and now stands at a seasonally adjusted 2.5 per cent of the labour force. Capacity utilisation in the business sector is high. The share of enterprises in Norges Bank's regional network reporting problems in accommodating demand has increased to 59 per cent. The primary capacity constraint is labour. Enterprises' estimates of this year's wage growth have been revised upwards somewhat, and there are reports of continued solid growth and positive prospects for the next six months. In manufacturing and the construction sector, order stocks are substantial and new orders and production are still on the rise. Building activity remains at a high level. The oil and gas sector has revised up its investment plans for 2007, largely as a result of increased exploration activity. Growth in corporate debt is picking up. In July, corporate debt to domestic creditors was 19.7 per cent higher than in July 2005. At the same time, corporate liquidity has increased substantially. Growth in household debt edged down in July, but is still high. Growth in consumption remains buoyant. Household goods consumption rose by 2.2 per cent from July 2005 to July 2006. House prices rose on a seasonally adjusted basis by 1.7 per cent from July to August, and are now 17.7 per cent higher than at the same time in 2005. TNS Gallup's trend indicator shows that households remain optimistic in their view of the domestic economy and their own financial situation. The twelve-month rise in the CPI slowed from 2.2 per cent in July to 1.9 per cent in August. Both imported and domestic inflation have been lower than expected. Consumer price inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was 0.4 per cent. If an adjustment is also made for the direct effect of the interest rate on house rents and the effects of lower maximum day-care rates, inflation can be estimated at 0.7 per cent, a decline from 0.9 per cent in July. Other measures of underlying inflation, such as the trimmed mean and the weighted median, rose by 1.3 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively, in August. According to TNS Gallup's expectations survey for the third quarter, expectations regarding the general rise in prices two years and five years ahead have increased somewhat. Expectations regarding wage growth in 2006 and 2007 are also higher than earlier. Long-term inflation expectations are still close to the inflation target. More business leaders than previously expect a faster rise in their selling prices in the coming year. Energy prices are exerting upward pressure on global inflation. Core inflation is still moderate in most countries, but has risen to 2.8 per cent in the US. Overall, growth among our trading partners has been higher than expected. Economic growth in Sweden, the UK and the euro area is high. In the US and Japan there are signs of slower growth. On balance, equity markets worldwide have shown little change. The benchmark index on the Oslo Stock Exchange has fallen by approximately 6 per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting. Crude oil prices have fallen by 21 per cent since the last monetary policy meeting, to about USD 57 per barrel. Futures prices have fallen less, to USD 66 per barrel at end-2008. Prices for non-oil commodities have edged down. Since the previous monetary policy meeting, the key rate has been raised by 0.25 percentage point in Sweden and Switzerland. Iceland's policy rate has been raised by 0.5 percentage point. Market participants expect that the tightening cycle will be concluded among most of our trading partners in the first half of 2007. For the US and Canada, market participants have priced in interest rate cuts of 0.5 percentage point over the next year. There has been a global decline in long-term interest rates. Interest rate expectations have also declined in Norway, but less than among trading partners. The import-weighted krone exchange rate (I-44) has depreciated by about 3½ per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting. So far in the third quarter, the krone exchange rate has been about 3 per cent weaker than projected in the June Inflation Report.

Charts - monetary policy meeting (150 kB)     Press release Norges Bank increases the interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to 3.00 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to raise the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 3.00 per cent with effect from 17 August 2006. The interest rate on banks' overnight loans is also being raised by 0.25 percentage point. Monetary policy is oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps - towards a more normal level. According to the monetary policy strategy in Inflation Report 2/06, the sight deposit rate should be in the interval 2¾ - 3¾ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 1 November, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. Capacity constraints and a shortage of skilled labour are posing a mounting challenge to a number of enterprises. At the same time, corporate earnings are very high. Local government tax revenues have increased substantially. Household and corporate borrowing remains high. Property prices are rising markedly, and the level of building activity is high. Growth among our trading partners is solid, and a number of countries have raised their policy rates. These factors point to a higher interest rate. At the same time, underlying consumer price inflation remains low. Clothing and footwear prices fell to a surprising extent in July. Different indicators of underlying inflation range from just under 1 per cent to almost 1¾ per cent, and energy prices are rising sharply. The krone exchange rate has depreciated somewhat recently, but is still fairly strong. The objective of bringing inflation back towards the target and anchoring inflation expectations implies a continued expansionary monetary policy. It is likely that continued high growth in output and employment will result in a gradual pick-up in inflation. The interest rate will therefore be set so that monetary policy gradually becomes less expansionary. The strategy published in the Inflation Report coupled with new information implies that the interest rate should be raised at the present meeting. Outlook and risk factors The analyses in Inflation Report 2/06 were based on a gradual increase in the interest rate towards a more normal level. In the first six months of 2006, the key rate was increased twice by increments of 0.25 percentage point. There are prospects that the interest rate will rise further at about the same pace. In the Inflation Report, capacity utilisation is projected to increase this year and in 2007. This will contribute to a gradual pick-up in inflation, bringing it close to the target of 2.5 per cent three years ahead. A gradual increase in the interest rate will curb growth in demand for goods and services and the rise in credit and house prices. The Inflation Report indicated that continued pronounced shifts in the import pattern, a strong krone exchange rate and keen domestic competition may result in lower-than-expected inflation. The Report also highlighted the risk that a long period of low real interest rates may result in more rapid output and employment growth and higher-than-projected price and cost inflation. High oil prices may have a stronger impact on consumer prices than seen so far. Moreover, stronger price impulses from our trading partners may translate into higher-than-expected imported price inflation. Overall, developments since the previous monetary policy meeting do not provide grounds for changing the outlook for inflation and output or the risk assessment. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information, which has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 29 June: Economic growth in Sweden, the UK and the euro area is high. Economic developments in China and India remain strong. GDP growth in the US and Japan has slowed. Consumer price inflation among a number of our trading partners is high as a result of rising energy prices, but the increase in prices for other goods and services remains moderate. Commodity prices have been volatile, but overall they have risen somewhat since the end of June. International equity markets have stabilised since the turbulence in May, and have edged up since the previous monetary policy meeting. Since the previous monetary policy meeting, the key rate has been raised by 0.25 percentage point in the US, the euro area, Denmark, the UK, Japan and Australia. In the US, there are now expectations that the interest rate has peaked, and that it will be lowered towards the end of 2007. A rise in key rates is expected over the next year in the euro area, Sweden, the UK, Australia, Japan and Switzerland. Interest rates among some trading partners have shown fairly wide variations. Overall, short-term interest rates among trading partners have been broadly unchanged, while long-term rates have edged down since the previous monetary policy meeting. The fall in interest rates has been most pronounced in the US. Crude oil prices rose during the summer, partly as a result of the conflict in the Middle East and reduced production in Nigeria and the US. The price of North Sea Brent Blend has fallen slightly in the last few days to around USD 74 per barrel, or about USD 2 higher than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. Futures prices have also risen, and are now between USD 74 and USD 77 per barrel up to end-2008. Market prices for electricity increased considerably this summer, and futures prices point to continued high electricity prices ahead. The import-weighted krone exchange rate (I-44) is around 1¾ per cent weaker than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. The year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE was 0.6 per cent in July, down from 0.8 per cent in June. Adjusted for the direct effect of the interest rate on house rents and the effects of lower maximum day-care rates, inflation can be estimated at 0.9 per cent in July and 1.1 per cent in June. The trimmed mean and weighted median showed a rate of increase of 1.5 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively, in July. The total consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.2 per cent in the year to July, compared with 2.1 per cent in June. According to Statistics Norway's Labour Force Survey, unemployment fell further in May. Employment has continued to rise, while the labour force has declined somewhat. Registered unemployment also fell in July, and now stands at a seasonally adjusted 2.6 per cent of the labour force. The number of work permits issued by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration is still rising. Seasonally adjusted household goods consumption fell from May to June, following a strong rise in May. House prices increased further this summer, and the twelve-month rise moved up to 15.8 per cent in July. Residential construction is still high. Growth in household debt (C2) has abated somewhat in recent months, but remains at a high level. The Oslo Stock Exchange benchmark index has risen by 1½ per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting, and is now 13 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year. Growth in total gross debt of mainland enterprises continues to rise. Listed companies posted very high operating results in the first half of 2006. Statistics Norway's business tendency survey for the second quarter is still giving positive signals regarding developments in Norwegian manufacturing. Capacity constraints and a shortage of skilled labour are posing a mounting challenge in some manufacturing sectors. A clear majority of industrial leaders assess the general outlook for the third quarter as more positive than for the second quarter. Tax statistics from Statistics Norway show that non-oil central government tax revenues were 10.4 per cent higher in the first half of 2006 than in the same period last year. Local government tax revenues rose by 9.9 per cent. Financial market participants expect a gradual rise in Norges Bank's key rate ahead. Interest rate expectations have been lowered somewhat in the medium term, albeit less than among trading partners.  Charts - monetary policy meeting(Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting    Press release Norges Bank keeps the interest rate unchanged Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave the interest rate unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 2.75 per cent. The overnight lending rate was also left unchanged. The analyses in the March Inflation Report implied an interest rate increase in May or June and further increases thereafter. The interest rate was raised in May. The slow rise in consumer prices for domestically produced goods and services in recent months may be an indication of solid productivity growth in the economy and intensified competition. On the other hand, growth is strong in the Norwegian economy and the projections for capacity utilisation have been revised upwards. There are prospects that inflation will pick up, but this may take time. Economic policy must increasingly reflect capacity constraints in the domestic economy. The assessment in the June Inflation Report implies that the interest rate may gradually - in small, not too frequent steps - be brought back towards a more normal level. According to the monetary policy strategy in the Report, the sight deposit rate should be in the interval 2¾ - 3¾ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 1 November, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. Outlook and risk factors In the first six months of 2006, the key rate has been increased in two increments of 0.25 percentage point. There are prospects that the interest rate will rise further at about the same pace. Economic growth is also solid in other countries. Norges Bank has assumed that money market rates among our trading partners will rise gradually in the years ahead. Low underlying inflation so far this year has contributed to a downward revision of the projection for inflation measured by the CPI-ATE in relation to the March Inflation Report. The stronger krone exchange rate will curb inflation this year and next, but this effect will subsequently unwind. With higher capacity utilisation, however, inflation will gradually pick up broadly in line with previous projections. There are prospects that inflation will be close to the target of 2.5 per cent three years ahead. A gradual increase in the interest rate will curb growth in demand for goods and services and the rise in credit and house prices. The Executive Board highlights the following risk factors: There may be stronger shifts in the import pattern than assumed in our projections. It may then take longer for the rise in prices for imported goods to pick up. Strong competition and high domestic productivity growth may dampen the rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services. The strong krone exchange rate may also contribute to low inflation. Lower inflation will, in isolation, imply an interest rate that is lower than the forecast in the Inflation Report. However, the risk that a period of low inflation will be followed by deflation seems to have diminished. Real interest rates have been very low for a period. Experience has shown that wage growth may rise sharply when output and employment growth pick up. This could lead to a subsequent decline in output and employment. High oil prices may have a stronger impact on consumer prices than seen so far. Stronger price impulses from our trading partners may result in higher-than-expected imported price inflation. If growth in the economy is stronger than assumed and inflation rises faster than expected, these developments will imply a more rapid interest rate increase. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 31 May: In the US, strong economic growth may have moderated somewhat in the past few months. In the euro area, the UK, Sweden and Japan growth remains solid. In China, the high rate of growth seems to be accelerating. The fall in equity prices in the US, Europe and Japan may indicate that equity market participants have become somewhat more uncertain about developments ahead. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices picked up in a number of countries in May as a result of higher energy prices. There are also signs of an accelerating rise in producer prices other than energy prices. Core inflation is still moderate, but has reached 2.4 per cent in the US. Since the previous monetary policy meeting, the key rate has been raised by 0.25 percentage point in the euro area, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. Interest rate expectations 12 months ahead have increased in the euro area, the UK, the US and Sweden. A rise in key rates is expected in the coming year in the US, Canada, the euro area, the UK, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Australia. Long-term international interest rates have risen. The price of Brent Blend has risen to about USD 72 per barrel. Futures prices indicate that oil prices will be above USD 70 per barrel in the coming year. Other commodity prices are markedly lower than at the end of May, although still higher than at the beginning of the year. The import-weighted exchange rate (I-44) is around 1¼ per cent weaker than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. Different measures of underlying inflation have been in the range 1-1½ per cent since last summer. The year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE adjusted for the interest rate's direct effect on house rents and the impact of lower maximum day-care rates can be estimated at 1.0 per cent in May. The total consumer price index rose by 2.3 per cent in the twelve months to May this year. TNS Gallup's second-quarter consumer confidence survey indicates that expectations concerning the general price level are stable among economists in the financial industry and academia. Among employer and employee organisations, expectations have edged up. Preliminary national accounts figures from Statistics Norway indicate that mainland GDP adjusted for seasonal variations rose by 0.6 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2006. In the same period, the number of employed rose by 0.9 per cent, while the number of person-hours worked rose by 0.6 per cent. According to Statistics Norway's Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment increased further in March and April. The decline in LFS unemployment since summer 2005 continued in April. Registered unemployment also fell in June. Sickness absence continued to increase in the first quarter. The centralised pay increases in this year's wage settlement imply that annual wage growth will as expected be somewhat higher in 2006 than in 2005. Statistics Norway's investment intentions surveys for the second quarter of 2006 point to solid investment growth in manufacturing and the power sector this year and next. Strong growth in planned investment in oil and gas extraction in 2006 has again been revised upwards somewhat. Growth in total gross debt for mainland enterprises showed a further increase in March. The benchmark index on the Oslo Stock Exchange has declined by approximately 13 per cent since 11 May, but is still about 11 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year. Household seasonally adjusted goods consumption increased in May. Household debt growth remains at a high level. House prices picked up markedly in May, and the year-on-year rise was 14.5 per cent. Building starts are still on the increase. Reports from Norges Bank's regional network indicate continued solid growth in demand and production in all industries. Growth is expected to remain high over the next six months. The share of enterprises facing capacity problems has risen. Enterprises believe that the rise in employment will continue, but labour shortages are a growing constraint on production. In spring, the enterprises in our regional network expected that wage growth would be moderate, while a greater number now expect that wage drift through the year may result in higher-than-budgeted wage growth in 2006. Prices for Norwegian export goods and prices for business services have risen at a faster pace. In retail trade, the rise in prices is still expected to be moderate. Expectations concerning money market rates in Norway have been revised upwards since the publication of the previous Inflation Report and since the previous monetary policy meeting.  Charts - monetary policy meeting (809 Kb) (Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting (138 Kb)     Press release Norges Bank increases the interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to raise the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75 per cent with effect from 1 June 06. The interest rate on banks' overnight loans is also being raised by 0.25 percentage point. Monetary policy is oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps - towards a more normal level. The monetary policy strategy presented in Inflation Report 1/06 is that the sight deposit rate should lie in the interval 2¼-3¼ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 29 June 2006, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. In line with the strategy, there were prospects of an interest rate increase at the monetary policy meeting in May or June. The level of activity in the Norwegian economy is high. Employment is rising more rapidly and unemployment has fallen more than projected in the previous Inflation Report. There are now signs of capacity constraints in a number of industries. Wage settlements so far indicate that wage growth will, as expected, be somewhat stronger this year than in 2005. Credit growth is strong and house price inflation is high. There are prospects of a further increase in interest rates among our trading partners. Underlying inflation is still low, and the krone has appreciated in recent months. The inflation outlook is at the same time being affected by the rise in prices for a number of commodities. The objective of bringing inflation back towards the target and anchoring inflation expectations implies a continued expansionary monetary policy. It is likely that continued high growth in output and employment will result in higher price and cost inflation, although this may take time. The interest rate will therefore be set so that monetary policy gradually becomes less expansionary. The overall assessment implies that the interest rate should be raised at this meeting. Outlook and risk factors The analyses in Inflation Report 1/06 were based on a gradual increase in the interest rate towards a more normal level. In the Report, there were prospects that inflation would gradually pick up and be close to the target of 2.5 per cent three years ahead. Capacity utilisation in the economy was projected to increase over the next two years. A further interest rate increase will after a period stabilise growth in output and employment, and capacity utilisation in the economy will decline as a result. This will curb the rise in inflation. Employment has recently risen more than projected, and unemployment is still falling. At the same time, sickness absence is rising again. The supply of labour from other countries is probably no longer sufficient to compensate for the increase in sickness absence and the number of persons on benefit. Other sources of information confirm the high level of activity in the Norwegian economy. Corporate profitability is solid, and there is a strong increase in the number of new orders in manufacturing and the construction industry. Credit growth is increasing rapidly in the enterprise sector and remains very high among households. The rise in house prices is still high. Equity prices have fallen recently, although this must be seen in the context of strong equity market growth in recent years. So far, there are no indications that financial market turbulence will have substantial, negative effects on domestic or global economic growth. Underlying inflation measured by the CPI-ATE remains low. At the same time, the krone has shown a noticeable appreciation. Different measures of underlying inflation result in different rates of inflation. The twelve-month rise in these measures varied between 1 and 1¾ per cent in April. While domestic prices have been somewhat lower than expected, prices for imported consumer goods have been slightly higher than expected. The Inflation Report indicated that continued strong shifts in the import pattern and increased domestic competition may result in lower-than-expected inflation. The Report also highlighted the risk that a long period of low real interest rates might result in more rapid output and employment growth and higher-than-projected price and cost inflation. The balance of risks ahead remains broadly unchanged. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 26 April: The global economy is exhibiting strong growth. GDP in the US expanded briskly again in the first quarter, with strong growth in private consumption. Economic growth in Japan is still strong. Growth has picked up in the euro area, and there are signs of improvement in Germany. The upturn in the Swedish economy is broadly based. Growth remained firm in the UK in the first quarter. Developments in energy and commodity prices have pushed up consumer price inflation among several of our trading partners. Core inflation is still moderate, but has recently picked up somewhat in several countries. Equity markets have been marked by turbulence since mid-May. Both short-term and long-term interest rates have shown considerable variation recently. Interest rate expectations among our trading partners, which have been rising for a longer period, have now edged down again. Interest rate expectations are still higher than when the Inflation Report was published in mid-March, and in the US and the UK they are also higher than they were at end-April. Since the previous monetary policy meeting, the key rate has been raised by 0.25 percentage point in the US, Canada, Hong Kong and Australia, and by 0.27 percentage point in China. Long-term international interest rates have fallen recently and are lower in the euro area and in Sweden than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. The price of Brent Blend now stands at USD 69 per barrel, about USD 5 lower than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. The price is lower partly because the International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised down its forecasts for growth in global demand for oil in 2006 and because US petrol stocks have increased. Futures prices have fallen somewhat, but are still at more than USD 70 per barrel up to end-2008. Other commodity prices have fallen somewhat since the previous monetary policy meeting, but price levels are still very high. The import-weighted krone exchange rate (I-44) is around 1 per cent stronger than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting and has so far in the second quarter been approximately 3 per cent stronger than the assumptions underlying the analyses in Inflation Report 1/06. The year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE, adjusted for the interest rate's direct effect on house rents and the effects of lower maximum day-care rates, can be estimated at 1.1 per cent in April. The rise in the total consumer price index (CPI) was 2.7 per cent in the year to April. The labour market is tightening. According to Statistics Norway's Labour Force Survey (LFS), the number of employed rose sharply in the first four months of this year. Registered unemployment continues to fall. Sickness absence is increasing. Wage settlements so far indicate that wage growth will, as expected, be somewhat stronger this year than in 2005. Overall, seasonally adjusted household goods consumption rose in March and April from the level in February. Growth in household credit from domestic sources (C2) edged down in April, although it is still high. House prices showed a sharp increase, recording a year-on-year rise in April of 12.9 per cent. Housing starts picked up again in March. The benchmark index on the Oslo Stock Exchange has fallen by 9 per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting. The decline has been most pronounced in commodity-related manufacturing. The benchmark index is nevertheless 14 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year. Statistics Norway's business sentiment survey shows that an increasing share of manufacturing leaders are reporting capacity problems and a shortage of qualified labour. There is a large number of projects on order in both manufacturing and the construction sector. Growth in total gross debt for mainland enterprises showed a further increase in February, and corporate liquidity is increasing substantially. In the Government's draft of the Revised National Budget for 2006, the structural non-oil budget deficit, measured as a percentage of trend mainland GDP, is estimated to increase by 0.5 percentage point from 2005 to 2006. Nominal underlying growth in central government expenditure is estimated at 5.3 per cent, which is 0.8 percentage point higher than in the budget approved last autumn. Growth in local government revenues is estimated at 6.1 per cent, adjusted upwards from 5.6 per cent. Financial market participants expect a gradual rise in Norges Bank's key rate ahead. Short-term term financial market expectations in Norway have risen somewhat in both the short and the long run since the previous monetary policy meeting. Short-term financial market expectations are slightly higher than the interest rate forecast in Inflation Report 1/06.  Charts - monetary policy meeting (872 kB) (Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting (143 kB)    Press release Norges Bank keeps the interest rate unchanged Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave the interest rate unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 2.50 per cent. The overnight lending rate was also left unchanged. Monetary policy is oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps - towards a more normal level. The monetary policy strategy presented in Inflation Report 1/06 is that the sight deposit rate should lie in the interval 2¼-3¼ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 29 June 2006, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. The underlying rise in consumer prices was approximately as expected in February and March, although the year-on-year rise is still low. The objective of bringing inflation back towards the target and anchoring inflation expectations implies a continued expansionary monetary policy. Output growth is high, and employment is rising more rapidly than expected. It is likely that continued high growth in output and employment will result in higher price and cost inflation, although this may take time. The interest rate will therefore be set so that monetary policy gradually becomes less expansionary. The interest rate was last raised in March. In line with the forecast in the March Inflation Report, there are prospects of another interest rate increase in the second quarter - at the monetary policy meeting in May or June - and a further increase thereafter. Outlook and risk factors The analyses in Inflation Report 1/06 were based on a gradual increase in the interest rate towards a more normal level. Core inflation was projected to increase to close to 2 per cent at the end of 2007 and be near the target of 2.5 per cent at the three-year horizon. Capacity utilisation in the economy was expected to rise over the next two years. A further interest rate increase will gradually stabilise growth in output and employment, and capacity utilisation in the economy may decline somewhat. This will curb the rise in inflation. The Inflation Report indicated that continued strong shifts in the import pattern may result in a further fall in prices for imported goods included in the consumer price index. Increased competition may also lead to low inflation. The Report also stated that it is uncertain how quickly price and wage inflation will accelerate when growth in output and employment picks up. Employment is now rising more rapidly than expected. Corporate earnings are rising and growth in corporate demand for credit has moved up. The sharp increase in household debt is persisting. House price inflation remains high. Prices for oil and several other commodities have picked up further. At the same time, the underlying rise in consumer prices is still low. So far, a tighter labour market does not seem to have resulted in higher-than-expected negotiated pay increases, but there is a risk that wage inflation may subsequently pick up more than expected. The krone is stronger than assumed. Overall, there are not sufficient grounds for changing the outlook for inflation and output or the assessment of risk factors. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting: Economic growth in the US probably picked up again in the first quarter. In Japan, growth appears to be solid. In the euro area, confidence indicators point to optimism in the business sector. There is a broad-based expansion in the Swedish economy, while some indicators in the UK have shown weak developments. Equity prices abroad are higher than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting on 16 March. High commodity prices are exerting upward pressure on consumer price inflation in a number of countries, although underlying inflation remains low. The central banks in the US, Canada and Switzerland have raised their key rates by 0.25 percentage points. Market expectations concerning key rates in other countries have risen slightly. For the year ahead, market pricing indicates that key rates will be increased in the euro area, the UK, Sweden, Switzerland, the US, Canada, Japan and Australia. The rise in global long-term interest rates has gained momentum. Oil prices have risen to over USD 74 per barrel, partly as a result of the uncertain political situation in a number of producer countries. Futures prices for Brent Blend are now more than USD 72 per barrel up to autumn 2008. Oil futures 6-7 years ahead have also risen, to approximately USD 69 per barrel. Metals prices have increased markedly. Over the past year, cobber prices have almost doubled and aluminium prices have risen by approximately 50 per cent. Measured by the import-weighted exchange rate index (I-44), the krone is about 2 per cent stronger than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. The year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE, adjusted for the interest rate's direct effect on house rents and the effects of lower maximum day-care rates, is estimated at 1.2 per cent in March. The total rise in the consumer price index (CPI) was 2.4 per cent, partly as a result of higher electricity prices and a rise in petrol prices. According to preliminary national accounts figures, growth in mainland GDP was 3.7 per cent in 2005. Growth in private services, construction and electricity production was strong. Person-hours worked rose by 0.9 per cent. The labour market continues to tighten at a rapid pace. According to Statistics Norway's Labour Force Survey (LFS), employment growth picked up markedly towards the end of 2005 and into 2006. LFS unemployment fell further in January, while the number of registered unemployed was approximately unchanged in March (seasonally adjusted). Sickness absence rose again in 2005. The wage settlements that have been completed so far may indicate that wage growth, as expected, will be somewhat higher this year than in 2005. The Oslo Stock Exchange has risen by 12 per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting and by 27 per cent so far this year. The rise in equity prices is related to strong growth in both reported and expected corporate earnings. Corporate results for the fourth quarter of 2005 were better than expected, and analysts have again increased their expectations concerning the results in 2006 and 2007. Adjusted for normal seasonal variations, household goods consumption fell slightly from January to February. Housing starts have edged down somewhat since the beginning of the year. House price inflation accelerated in March. Twelve-month growth in household credit remains strong. Growth in total gross debt for mainland enterprises is showing a pronounced rise. Commercial building starts remain robust. Manufacturing output is expanding. Reports from Norges Bank's regional network in March point to solid growth in demand and production in all industries. Growth is expected to remain high over the next six months. About half of the contacts report that they will have some or considerable problems in accommodating an increase in demand. This is a higher share than was the case last autumn. Employment is rising in all industries, including the local government and hospital sectors. Labour shortages have increased over the past six months and are most pronounced in construction, oil-related manufacturing and some service sectors. Our contacts expect higher wage growth this year than in 2005. In retail and the household service sector, only a moderate rise in prices is expected in the near term. Financial markets still expect a gradual increase in the sight deposit rate ahead. In line with developments in global markets, the rise in Norwegian long-term interest rates has gathered pace.  Charts - monetary policy meeting (922 kB) (Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting (170 kB)     Press release Norges Bank increases the interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.50 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to raise the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.50 per cent with effect from 17 March 2006. The interest rate on banks' overnight loans is also being raised by 0.25 percentage point. Monetary policy is oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps. The interest rate was last raised in November. The analyses in the previous Inflation Report implied another increase at the monetary policy meeting in January or March and a further interest rate increase thereafter. Consumer price inflation was unexpectedly low in December and January, but picked up slightly again in February. Output growth is high, and employment is now rising more rapidly than expected. It is likely that continued high growth in output and employment will result in higher price and cost inflation, although this may take time. The objective of bringing inflation back towards the target and anchoring inflation expectations implies a continued expansionary monetary policy. The overall assessment in the Inflation Report presented today is in line with the strategy in the previous Report. The assessment implies a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps - towards a more normal level. The monetary policy strategy in Inflation Report 1/06 is that the sight deposit rate should lie in the interval 2¼-3¼ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 29 June 2006, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with the projections. Outlook and risk factors The analyses in Inflation Report 1/06 imply that the interest rate should be gradually - in small, not too frequent steps - brought back towards a more normal level. Money market rates among our trading partners are also assumed to rise over the next three years. Such interest rate developments in Norway and abroad may be consistent with an approximately unchanged krone exchange rate. The high rate of economic growth implies that price and cost inflation will edge up after a period. With a reduction in unemployment, wage growth is expected to accelerate. At the same time, it will probably be easier for enterprises to pass on cost increases to prices in pace with the rise in demand and capacity utilisation. Core inflation is projected to increase from the current level, around 1¼ per cent, and approach 2 per cent at the end of 2007. There are prospects that it will increase further and be close to the target of 2.5 per cent three years ahead. Capacity utilisation in the economy is expected to rise over the next two years. Even though a gradual increase in the interest rate will curb demand growth after a period, monetary policy will still be expansionary for a period ahead. A further interest rate increase will gradually stabilise growth in output and employment, and capacity utilisation in the economy may decline somewhat. This will curb the rise in inflation. The Executive Board would highlight the following risk factors: Consumer price inflation has been unexpectedly low in recent years. If strong shifts in the import pattern continue, it may take longer for the rise in prices for imported goods to pick up. Increased domestic competition with strong productivity growth in some industries has dampened consumer price inflation. Persistently low inflation might imply that the interest rate is rising more slowly than the forecast in the Inflation Report. Real interest rates have been very low for a period. With labour market tightening, wage growth has in previous periods shown a rapid and sharp increase. There are some indications that wage growth has picked up for some groups of employees. Economic growth that is stronger than assumed would in isolation suggest a more rapid interest rate increase to prevent resource shortages from increasing and inflation from eventually overshooting the target. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting: The global economic upturn is continuing, with the US, Japan and China making the main contribution. The upswing seems to be broadening to other countries. In the euro area, there is rising optimism in both the enterprise and household sectors. Activity in Sweden is picking up. A number of Asian economies are still showing brisk growth. High prices for oil and other commodities have pushed up inflation somewhat in many countries, but there has been no substantial rise in core inflation so far. The European Central Bank and the central banks in the US, Canada, Sweden and Denmark have raised their key rates since the end of January. Market participants appear to be expecting interest rates to increase gradually in the period ahead both in Sweden and the euro area. In the US, the key rate is expected to rise by a further 0.25-0.50 percentage point before a peak is reached. In the UK, economic agents envisage approximately unchanged interest rates ahead. Global long-term interest rates have risen slightly. The Bank of Japan has changed its operating target for monetary policy. The objective of maintaining a particularly high level of liquidity in the banking system no longer applies. The new operating target is the uncollateralised overnight call rate, which will still be kept at zero per cent. Market participants seem to be expecting the rate to be raised to 0.5 per cent in the course of the next twelve months. Equity prices abroad are higher than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting on 25 January. In Norway, prices have risen by about 7 per cent. The price of oil remains at USD 62 per barrel, the same as at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. Oil futures prices 6-7 years ahead are also at the same level as at the time of the January policy meeting. Figures from Statoil's and Hydro's quarterly reports show that export prices for Norwegian natural gas rose by 28 per cent from the third to the fourth quarter of 2005. Measured by the import-weighted exchange rate index (I-44), the krone is about ¾ per cent stronger than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. The year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE, adjusted for the interest rate's direct effect on house rents and the effects of lower maximum day-care rates, is estimated at 1.3 per cent in February. Total consumer price inflation (CPI) reached 2.6 per cent, partly as a result of higher electricity prices. Figures from both the Directorate of Labour and Statistics Norway indicate that the labour market is now rapidly tightening. In February, there were 19 000 fewer unemployed registered at unemployment offices than one year earlier. Adjusted for seasonal variations, unemployed persons accounted for 2.9 per cent of the labour force. According to Statistics Norway's LFS figures, employment increased sharply around the turn of the year. LFS unemployment has also fallen markedly. The Technical Reporting Committee on Income Settlements has estimated annual wage growth in 2005 for employees as a whole at just over 3¼ per cent, which is the lowest figure since 1995. In industries where bonus payments have an influence, wages increased considerably more, but wage growth was low in the hotel and restaurant industry and the construction industry. Overall, household goods consumption picked up somewhat in December and January. TNS Gallup's trend indicator, which measures households' assessment of and expectations concerning their own financial situation and the Norwegian economy, fell slightly from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2006, but remains at a high level. Twelve-month growth in credit to households remains high. The rise in house prices remains at a high level and the number of housing starts is high. Manufacturing output has picked up further in recent months. Statistics Norway's investment intentions survey for 2006 indicates that manufacturing investment plans are at about the same level as in 2005. The investment intentions survey for the oil and gas industry indicates that the high investment level in 2005 will be sustained in 2006. According to Statistics Norway's business tendency survey for the fourth quarter of 2005, a high proportion of business leaders expect increased employment. New orders for the manufacturing and construction industries show solid growth. Commercial building starts are at a high level. Growth in total gross debt for mainland enterprises showed a further rise in November. Information from Norges Bank's regional network in January and February points to solid growth in demand and production in all industries. About half of the contacts report that they foresee some or considerable problems in accommodating an increase in demand. This is a higher number than previously. The construction industry appears to be operating at capacity limits. Manufacturing also reports that capacity utilisation is high, particularly among suppliers to the petroleum industry. Annual wage growth is expected to be somewhat higher in 2006 than in 2005. Financial markets still expect a gradual increase in the sight deposit rate ahead. Market interest rate expectations are somewhat higher than at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. Long-term interest rates in Norway have to some extent followed the upward movement in external interest rates.  Charts - monetary policy meeting (977 Kb) (Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting (168 Kb)     Press release Norges Bank keeps the interest rate unchanged Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to leave the interest rate unchanged. Norges Bank's key interest rate, the sight deposit rate, therefore remains at 2.25 per cent. The overnight lending rate was also left unchanged. Monetary policy is oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate - in small, not too frequent steps - towards a more normal level. In Inflation Report 3/05, the assessment of the Executive Board was that the sight deposit rate should lie in the interval 2-3 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on March 16, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with the projections. The analyses in the Inflation Report implied an increase in the interest rate in the first quarter, at the monetary policy meeting in January or March, and further increases in the interest rate thereafter. New information that has emerged in the period to this monetary policy meeting provides mixed signals. The fall in registered unemployment and the increase in the number of vacancies may indicate that the labour market is tightening more rapidly than assumed. Wage growth remains low, but appears to be rising for some groups of employees. House prices are rising and credit growth continues to increase. On the other hand, consumer price inflation over the past few months has been lower than expected. Inflation can vary considerably from month to month. There is uncertainty with regard to inflation over the coming months because many enterprises change their selling prices at the beginning of the year. Tax increases and lower day-care rates add to the uncertainty surrounding inflation in the first quarter. The high rate of growth in the economy indicates that underlying inflation will gradually pick up, but it is uncertain how rapidly this will occur. The risk factors on each side seem to be somewhat more marked now, but do not as a whole provide grounds for changing the assessment of the outlook. Outlook and risk factors The projections in Inflation Report 3/05 were based on a gradual increase in the interest rate towards a more normal level. Inflation as measured by the CPI-ATE was projected to rise gradually and reach the target of 2.5 per cent in 2008. Mainland output is now probably above its normal level. The output gap, which is a measure of capacity utilisation in the economy, is estimated to increase further in 2006. A monetary policy stance that gradually becomes less expansionary will stabilise the economy over time, thereby preventing inflation from overshooting the target. The Inflation Report pointed to the risk that a low interest rate over a long period may result in strong pressures in the economy, with a risk of bottlenecks, rising cost inflation and debt accumulation. The Report also noted that continued trade shifts and increased competition in labour and product markets might result in lower price and wage inflation and weaker pressures in the economy. The Report highlighted global economic uncertainty, and stated that different developments in global growth and in oil prices might result in a different path for the Norwegian economy than projected. The labour market may be somewhat tighter than expected. At the moment, total wage growth seems to be broadly in line with the projection. There are, however, some indications that wage growth has picked up for some groups of employees. Equity prices have risen in Norway, and credit growth has accelerated further. These factors may in isolation point to high levels of activity in parts of the economy. At the same time, both imported and domestic inflation have been lower than expected. This has some similarities to the alternative scenario of stronger trade shifts and increased competition. Oil prices have fluctuated since the beginning of November, but are now somewhat higher than assumed in the Inflation Report. There are prospects that the interest rate level will rise among a number of our trading partners and the krone is somewhat weaker than assumed. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information that has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 14 December: Economic growth in the US appears to remain solid. According to indicators for the fourth quarter in the US, the picture is still positive for manufacturing. There are signs of somewhat weaker developments in consumption and some signs of a slowdown in the housing market. In the euro area, various confidence indicators reflect increasing optimism in both the corporate and the household sectors. At the same time, growth in private consumption is still weak. In Japan, industrial production has increased, although unemployment has also risen. There has been some improvement in consumer confidence, and retail trade increased slightly in November after falling in the previous months. In the UK, manufacturing developments are still weak, but there are signs that consumption growth is increasing. Activity in Sweden has picked up. Exports and retail trade exhibited solid growth in November. Indicators for December showed high activity in the construction sector and retail trade. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices has slowed in the US, the euro area, the UK and Japan. Consumer price inflation is nevertheless still high in the US and slightly above the monetary policy target in the euro area. Inflation has picked up somewhat in Sweden, although it remains low. Since our previous monetary policy meeting, the interest rate has been raised by 0.25 percentage point in Sweden, Canada, Switzerland and Hong Kong. Market participants are expecting interest rate increases in the course of the next three months in the US, the euro area, Denmark, Sweden, Canada and Switzerland. In the UK and Australia, the interest rate is expected to remain unchanged in the coming year. Long-term international interest rates have fallen. The benchmark index on the Oslo Stock Exchange has risen by 3 per cent since mid-December. Equity prices abroad have varied, but are currently at about the same level as at the time of the previous monetary policy meeting. Oil prices have increased by about USD 4 since mid-December and now stand at around USD 63 per barrel. Long-term oil futures have risen somewhat more. The import-weighted exchange rate (I-44) has depreciated by just over 1 per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was 0.9 per cent in December, down from 1.1 per cent in November. Statistics Norway's inflation indicators varied between 0.9 and 1.8 per cent in December. Adjusted for the interest rate's direct effect on house rents, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE is estimated at 1.0 per cent in December. The rise in the total consumer price index (CPI) was 1.8 per cent. Inflation as measured by the CPI-ATE is now 0.4 percentage point lower than projected in the previous Inflation Report. Registered unemployment fell more than expected in the fourth quarter. Statistics Norway's LFS unemployment is higher, but has now begun to fall. Employment is showing moderate growth. The number of registered vacancies has increased. After falling sharply through 2004, there are indications that sickness absence is rising slightly again. Preliminary figures from Statistics Norway indicate that annual wage growth in retail trade was relatively low in 2005, but somewhat higher than assumed in the Inflation Report. High wage growth has already been recorded in the financial industry and among chartered engineers. Nevertheless, overall wage growth was probably low last year. Retail sales picked up in November, but developments in goods consumption have been weaker than expected in recent months. The Confederation of Norwegian Commercial and Service Enterprises reports strong growth in trade at shopping centres in December. Twelve-month growth in credit to households from domestic sources (C2) rose to 13.2 per cent in November. In recent months, house price inflation has stabilised at a high level. Housing starts have moderated since summer, but rose somewhat in November. Manufacturing production edged up again in the period from September to November after exhibiting a falling trend for some months. Growth in corporate debt moved up in October. Commercial building starts have shown higher growth in recent months. New figures from the Petroleum Directorate indicate that petroleum investment will remain at a high level in the years ahead. The volume of traditional merchandise imports continued to expand from the third to the fourth quarter, while the volume of traditional merchandise exports remained approximately unchanged. Financial market participants expect a gradual rise in Norges Bank's key rate ahead. The expected money market rate has fallen in both the short and long term, with long-term rates showing the steepest decline. The decline in interest rates is being ascribed to lower long-term interest rates among our trading partners, the proposed changes in capital adequacy requirements for Norwegian insurance companies and unexpectedly low inflation in December.  Charts - monetary policy meeting(Store the file, call it up in PowerPoint, and then double-click on individual charts in order to gain access to the underlying data.)  Charts - monetary policy meeting    Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 0.50 percent Norges Bank's Executive Board has decided to leave the key policy rate unchanged at 0.50 percent. There are prospects that inflation will be lower than expected earlier. This implies, in isolation, a lower key policy rate in the period ahead. On the other hand, the upturn in the real economy appears to have taken hold, and unemployment has declined. Inflation expectations appear to be firmly anchored. With a key policy rate close to the current level, there are prospects that inflation will pick up again further out. An even lower key policy rate could lead to a further acceleration in house price inflation and debt accumulation. \"Monetary policy is expansionary and supportive of structural adjustments in the Norwegian economy. The Executive Board's current assessment of the outlook suggests that the key policy rate will most likely remain at today's level in the period ahead,\" says Governor Øystein Olsen. The forecast for the key policy rate in Monetary Policy Report 1/17 is close to ½% in the coming years. At the same time, the forecast implies a slightly higher probability of a decrease than an increase in the key policy rate in the coming period. The forecast is little changed from the December Report, but suggests that the key policy rate will remain close to the current level somewhat longer than projected earlier.

Expected policy rates for Norway's trading partners have increased since September. Oil prices have risen and are now somewhat higher than expected, while the krone has appreciated more than anticipated. There are prospects that inflation will be lower than projected and that activity in the Norwegian economy is picking up at a somewhat slower pace than projected in September. Changes in the outlook for inflation and capacity utilisation imply, in isolation, a somewhat lower key policy rate in the coming years. On the other hand, the rapid rise in house prices and household debt has increased the risk of a sharp fall in demand further out. A lower key policy rate increases the risk of a further acceleration in house price inflation and debt accumulation. The risk of a build-up of financial imbalances and the uncertainty surrounding the effects of a lower key policy rate now suggest a cautious approach to interest rate setting. \"Our current assessment of the outlook suggests that the key policy rate will most likely remain at today's level in the period ahead,\" says Governor Øystein Olsen. The analyses in this Report suggest that the key policy rate will remain close to ½% in the coming years. At the same time, the key policy rate forecast implies a slightly higher probability of a decrease than an increase in the key policy rate in the year ahead.

The Executive Board indicated in September that the key policy rate would most likely remain at 0.50 percent in the period ahead. Expected policy rates among trading partners have risen slightly since the monetary policy meeting in September. At the same time, oil prices have increased somewhat more than assumed and the krone has appreciated. Overall capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy appears to be broadly as projected in September. House prices and household debt have risen somewhat more than projected. Consumer price inflation has been lower than expected. \"Overall, developments since September do not differ substantially from the projections in the September Monetary Policy Report.

The growth prospects for imports among Norway’s trading partners have weakened somewhat since June, and expected policy rates abroad have declined slightly. Oil prices are at about the same level as before summer, while the krone has appreciated somewhat. The Norwegian money market premium has increased and been higher than expected. Inflation in Norway has been unexpectedly high in recent months. At the same time, there are signs that growth in the Norwegian economy is picking up at a slightly faster pace than projected in June. House price inflation has accelerated and been higher than projected. Low interest rates may contribute to a persistently high rate of increase in house prices and increase the vulnerability of the financial system. On the other hand, growth in the Norwegian economy is moderate, and capacity utilisation is below a normal level. As a result of low cost growth and a somewhat stronger krone, inflation is likely to recede further ahead. “Our current assessment of the outlook suggests that the key policy rate will most likely remain at today’s level in the period ahead,” says Governor Øystein Olsen. The analyses in this Report suggest that the key policy rate will remain close to ½ percent in the next few years. At the same time, the key policy rate forecast implies a slightly higher probability of a decrease than an increase in the key policy rate in the year ahead.

Growth in the world economy is moderate, and oil prices have risen further since March. Financial markets have recently been marked by the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the UK referendum on continued EU membership. Expected policy rates among trading partners have declined since the March Report. The krone has been stronger than anticipated. Growth in the Norwegian economy is likely to remain weak in the coming period, even though the upswing in oil prices may reduce uncertainty and push up demand somewhat. Should the rapid rise in house prices persist, household vulnerabilities may increase. Inflation has for a period been higher than 2.5%, but lower wage growth and a somewhat stronger krone will weigh down on inflation ahead. \"There are still prospects that the key policy rate may be reduced in the course of the year,\" says Governor Olsen.

On the whole, developments since March have not deviated substantially from the projections in the March 2016 Monetary Policy Report. Consumer price inflation remains elevated, but a stronger krone may contribute to a slightly more rapid decrease in inflation than projected in March.

The Board has therefore decided to lower the key policy rate\", says Governor Øystein Olsen. It appears that global growth will be somewhat lower than expected and interest rates abroad have fallen. Developments in the Norwegian economy have been weaker than foreseen and unemployment is expected to edge up. The krone depreciation has pushed up consumer price inflation. There are prospects that wage growth will be lower in 2016 than in 2015. As the effects of the krone depreciation unwind, inflation will drift down. \"The current outlook for the Norwegian economy suggests that the key policy rate may be reduced further in the course of the year\", says Governor Øystein Olsen. Lower interest rates could increase financial system vulnerabilities. As the key policy rate approaches a lower bound, the uncertainty surrounding the effects of monetary policy increases. This now suggests proceeding with greater caution in interest rate setting. Should the Norwegian economy be exposed to new major shocks, the Executive Board will, however, not exclude the possibility that the key policy rate may turn negative.

Going forward, household consumption and private sector investment are expected to be lower than previously projected. On the other hand, an expansionary fiscal policy will support demand for goods and services. Overall, there are prospects that growth ahead will be somewhat weaker than anticipated. Unemployment is expected to rise slightly more than projected in the September Monetary Policy Report. Monetary policy is expansionary and is supporting the restructuring of the Norwegian economy. The krone has depreciated and inflation has picked up. A lower key policy rate may increase the risk of a more rapid rise in real estate prices and debt. Uncertainty as to the effects of the monetary policy stance suggests a cautious approach to interest rate setting. \"An overall assessment of the outlook and balance of risks led the Executive Board to conclude that the key policy rate should be kept unchanged at this meeting.

The effects of the fall in oil prices and decline in oil investment are gradually becoming evident, especially in regions closely linked to the oil industry. Unemployment has edged up as expected, while household goods consumption has been lower than projected. Overall, policy rate expectations among Norway's trading partners have fallen somewhat. On the other hand, the krone exchange rate has been weaker than projected, and a more expansionary fiscal policy will contribute to fuelling demand for goods and services. Inflation has been in line with projections in the September 2015 Monetary Policy Report.

The Board has therefore decided to lower the key policy rate now”, says Governor Øystein Olsen. Growth in the Norwegian economy is likely to remain low for a longer period than projected earlier owing to the fall in oil prices through summer. Oil investment is expected to fall to a further extent than projected in June, and lower demand for goods and services from the petroleum sector will reduce activity in other parts of the economy. On the other hand, a weaker krone will contribute to strengthening the profitability of export and import-competing firms. Unemployment is projected to continue to edge up. House price inflation has been a little higher than projected, albeit with wide regional dispersion. Household debt has continued to grow at a faster pace than income. The krone depreciation has pushed up consumer price inflation. Low wage growth is keeping down cost growth, and inflation will edge down as the effects of the krone depreciation unwind. “The current outlook for the Norwegian economy suggests that the key policy rate may be reduced further in the coming year”, says Governor Øystein Olsen.  Background material and charts For more information, please contact:Director of Communications and External Relations, Hilde SingsaasTel: +47 22 31 69 47 / +47 99 54 19 63    Press release Key policy rate lowered by 0.25 percentage point to 1.00 percent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided to lower the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.00 percent. \"Developments in the Norwegian economy have been slightly weaker than expected and the economic outlook has deteriorated somewhat.

Wage growth in 2015 is set to be lower than projected in March. According to Norges Bank's regional network, output growth has edged down and reporting enterprises expect growth to remain weak over the next half-year. Further out, there are prospects that the decline in oil investment will be less pronounced than projected earlier. Consumer price inflation is close to 2.5 percent. The krone depreciation in 2014 will underpin inflation in the coming period. Further ahead, lower wage growth and fading effects of a weaker krone will pull down on inflation.

Developments in the Norwegian economy have been broadly in line with that projected in the December 2014 Monetary Policy Report. Inflation is close to 2.5 percent. Unemployment has remained stable and been slightly lower than projected. At the same time, the outlook ahead is somewhat weaker than anticipated in December. Oil prices have continued to drift down and activity in the petroleum industry may decrease to a further extent than assumed earlier. Wage growth in 2014 was lower than projected and there are expectations that wages will also in the period ahead increase somewhat less than projected earlier. Several central banks have eased monetary policy in recent months and the expected increase in foreign policy rates has been pushed further out. \"If economic developments ahead are broadly in line with that projected, there are prospects for a reduction in the key policy rate\", says Governor Olsen.

The upturn in the world economy remains moderate and there is considerable uncertainty surrounding developments ahead. Growth prospects for the Norwegian economy have weakened. Activity in the petroleum industry is softening and the sharp fall in oil prices is likely to amplify this tendency. This will have spillover effects on the wider economy and unemployment may edge up ahead. At the same time, the krone has depreciated markedly, which is helping to dampen the effects on the Norwegian economy and underpin inflation. \"The analysis in the Monetary Policy Report presented today implies a key policy rate of 1¼ percent, or somewhat lower, in the period towards the end of 2016\", says Governor Øystein Olsen. Capacity utilisation in the mainland economy will probably decline to a further extent than projected earlier, but is expected to increase again towards the end of the projection period.

The key policy rate is low because inflation is low and because interest rates abroad are very low. Growth prospects for our trading partners have weakened, but global growth remains robust. Capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is somewhat above a normal level and unemployment is low. At the same time, there are now prospects that it will take longer for inflation to move up to the inflation target. \"The analyses suggest that the key policy rate be kept low longer than previously anticipated. The first increase in the key policy rate is now projected to take place in spring 2014,\" says Governor Øystein Olsen. At the meeting, the Executive Board decided that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1–2 percent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 20 June 2013, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.

Inflation in Norway is low. Against this background, the key policy rate is left unchanged at 1.5 percent,\" says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. There is still considerable uncertainty surrounding global economic developments. Activity in the euro area may continue to recede into next year. Interest rates abroad have edged down further. On the other hand, credit risk premiums have declined and euro area countries have agreed on actions that may improve the situation in Europe. The Norwegian economy is growing at a solid pace. Unemployment is low and capacity utilisation is above a normal level. Since the previous monetary policy meeting, developments have been broadly in line with the projections in the October 2012 Monetary Policy Report. \"Developments in the Norwegian economy give reason to believe that inflation will gradually pick up. This suggests that the key policy rate can be raised further out,\" says the Deputy Governor. For further information, see \"The Executive Board's monetary policy decision – background and general assessment\" and \"The Executive Board's assessment\" in the October 2012 Monetary Policy Report. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 1.5 percent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 1.5 percent. \"The key policy rate is being kept at a low level because inflation is low and global interest rates are at very low levels,\" says Governor Øystein Olsen. Growth among Norway's trading partners is weak and the uncertainty surrounding developments in the international economy is elevated. Measures by a number of central banks have, nevertheless, contributed to easing financial market tensions recently. Growth in the Norwegian economy is solid and capacity utilisation is somewhat higher than normal. The krone has appreciated. Lower premiums in money and bond markets have reduced banks' funding costs. At the same time, interest rates on banks' loans to households and enterprises have remained unchanged. \"Developments in the Norwegian economy give reason to believe that inflation will gradually pick up. The analyses in this Report suggest that the key policy rate should be kept at today's level into next year, followed by a gradual increase towards a more normal level. The forecast for the key policy rate in 2013 is slightly lower than the June forecast,\" says the Governor. At the meeting, the Executive Board decided that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1% – 2% until the publication of the next Report on 14 March 2013, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.

External growth is sluggish and interest rates abroad are very low. Against this background, the key policy rate is kept unchanged at 1.5 per cent,\" says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. Developments in both Norway and among trading partners have been broadly in line with expectations. Inflation in Norway has been slightly lower than projected and the krone has recently appreciated somewhat. The expected upward shift in interest rates abroad has been deferred further ahead. At the same time, premiums in money and bond markets have declined. \"In June, the key policy rate was projected to remain at today's level in the period to the turn of the year. New information does not warrant a change to this assessment.\" says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad.

Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 1.5 percent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 1.5 percent. \"The level of uncertainty surrounding developments in Europe is now higher than it has been for some time. Although domestic developments have been slightly stronger than expected, the turbulence and weak growth prospects abroad suggest the key policy rate should be kept on hold,\" says Governor Øystein Olsen. Economic growth among Norway's trading partners is expected to be even lower than previously projected. Central bank key rates are close to zero in many countries and the expected upward shift in interest rates has been deferred further into the future. Growth in the Norwegian economy has been slightly stronger than expected so far this year. Unemployment is low and wage growth may turn out to be somewhat higher than previously projected. A strong krone and weak growth abroad are still holding down inflation at a low level, but developments in the Norwegian economy suggest that inflation will drift up further ahead. \"The analyses in this Monetary Policy Report imply a key policy rate at about today's level towards the end of 2012. Thereafter, the key policy rate is projected to rise gradually towards a more normal level. However, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding economic developments ahead,\" underlines the Governor. At the meeting, the Executive Board decided that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1% – 2% until the publication of the next Report on 31 October 2012, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.

Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 1.5 percent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 1.5 percent. Webcast of press conference (in Norwegian) “There are signs that activity in the Norwegian economy is slightly higher than expected, but tensions in international financial markets have flared up again,” says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. Central bank key rates are close to zero in many countries and the expected upward shift in interest rates abroad has been deferred further ahead. Weak growth prospects in Europe and a strong krone are holding down inflation at a low level and restraining growth among Norwegian companies exposed to international competition. Capacity utilisation is close to a normal level, with vigorous activity in petroleum-related industries. Contacts in Norges Bank’s regional network report that activity growth has been somewhat higher than expected. Consumer price inflation has been broadly in line with projections and underlying inflation is now between 1 and 1½ percent “In the latest Monetary Policy Report presented in March, the key policy rate was projected to remain at today’s level over the coming year. On the basis of an overall assessment of new information since that time, the picture remains broadly unchanged,” says the Deputy Governor. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment” and “The Executive Board’s assessment” in the March 2012 Monetary Policy Report. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate reduced by 0.25 percentage point to 1.50 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.50 per cent. “The continuing downturn abroad and the strong krone are contributing to keeping inflation low and are weighing on growth in Norway. Against this background, the Executive Board has decided to reduce the key policy rate”, says Governor Øystein Olsen. Even though the situation in international financial markets has improved somewhat after the turn of the year, there are prospects of low growth and low interest rates for a long time in most advanced economies. Growth in the Norwegian economy is holding up, but growth projections have been lowered somewhat. The krone is strong and inflation is projected to remain between 1¼ - 1½ percent to the end of the year. The analyses in Monetary Policy Report 1/12 indicate that it will likely take several years until inflation returns to target. “The current outlook suggests that the key policy rate may remain low longer than projected earlier. There is a high level of uncertainty regarding economic developments, and we have monetary policy leeway in both directions”, says the Governor. At its meeting today, the Executive Board decided that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1-2 percent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 20 June 2012, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s assessment” in the March 2012 Monetary Policy Report. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 1.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce the key policy rate by 0.50 percentage point to 1.75 per cent. “The turbulence in financial markets has intensified and external growth is now expected to be clearly weaker, particularly in the euro area. In order to dampen the impact on the Norwegian economy, the Executive Board has decided to lower the key policy rate”, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. Inflation is low. Even though activity in the Norwegian economy remains robust, primarily driven by petroleum investment and a high level of housing construction, a number of indicators suggest lower growth ahead. There is a high degree of uncertainty as to economic developments in the coming months. The debt situation in the euro area has led to considerable problems in the European banking system and in money and credit markets. Market funding has also become more expensive and less accessible for Norwegian banks. “In order to guard against an economic setback and even lower inflation, we are of the view that a reduction in the key policy rate is now appropriate”, says the Deputy Governor. For further information, see ”The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment” and “The Executive Board’s assessment” in the October 2011 Monetary Policy Report. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent. “Based on Norges Bank’s current assessment, the key policy rate will be kept at the current level for some time ahead”, says Governor Øystein Olsen. Advanced economies are likely facing an amplified and prolonged downturn. Financial markets are marked by turbulence and uncertainty. “Turbulence and weaker prospects abroad are also affecting the outlook for the Norwegian economy”, says Governor Olsen. Inflation is low in Norway, but growth in the Norwegian economy remains robust. There is an unusually high level of uncertainty surrounding developments ahead. The analyses in the October 2011 Monetary Policy Report suggest that the key policy rate will increase again in a year’s time. “If the turbulence abroad intensifies and the outlook for growth and inflation weakens further, the key policy rate may be reduced. If there are prospects for higher growth and inflation, the key rate may rise earlier”, says Governor Olsen. The Executive Board decided at its meeting on 19 October that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1¾–2¾ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 14 March 2012, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s assessment” in the October 2011 Monetary Policy Report. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent. ”The prospects for the world economy have weakened considerably in the course of summer. External developments and the turbulence in financial markets are also affecting the domestic outlook. Against this background, we have chosen to leave the key policy rate unchanged at this meeting,” says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. The turbulence linked to the European debt crisis has intensified. Growth is weak and there are prospects that key rates abroad will be very low over several years ahead. Developments in the Norwegian economy remain favourable, but output and demand for goods and service have also been somewhat weaker than expected at home. Consumer price inflation has slowed. “The key policy rate is low. Our analysis in June implied a gradual increase in the key policy rate through the final half of the year. The turbulence and uncertainty abroad, combined with lower inflation and weaker prospects at home, suggest that the key policy rate should be kept low for a longer period than expected in June” says the Deputy Governor. For further information, see \"The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment\" and “The Executive Board’s assessment” in the June 2011 Monetary Policy Report. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent. “The decision must especially be seen against the background of the recent flare-up in financial market turbulence and clear signs of weaker growth internationally,” says Governor Øystein Olsen. The analyses Norges Bank presented in June suggested a gradual increase in the key policy rate through the latter half of the year. The Norwegian economy is still growing at a robust pace and domestic developments have been broadly in line with that projected. This suggests that the key policy rate should be raised further. On the other hand, inflation is low. Growth among trading partners appears to be weaker than expected. Combined with the turbulence in financial markets, this also has an impact on the outlook for the Norwegian economy. “An overall assessment of the outlook and the balance of risk suggests that the key policy rate be left unchanged at this meeting,” says Governor Olsen. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment and “The Executive Board’s assessment” in the June 2011 Monetary Policy Report. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent. The projections in Monetary Policy Report 2/11 suggest that the interest rate should be raised gradually through the autumn. The Norwegian economy is faring well, and unemployment is declining. Inflation is low, but is likely to pick up gradually. “The key policy rate was raised in May and is kept unchanged at this meeting, and the key policy rate is still projected to increase gradually through the second half of 2011,” says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. “Sovereign debt problems in Greece and other European countries have caused renewed financial turbulence, with the result that equity prices have fallen and long-term yields are again very low. However, global economic growth seems to be maintaining its momentum. We assume that the debt problems facing Greece will be resolved without significant spillover effects on other countries\", says Deputy Governor Qvigstad. The Executive Board also decided at its meeting that the key policy rate should be in the interval 2¼–3¼ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 19 October 2011, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s assessment” in the June 2011 Monetary Policy Report. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate increased to 2.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to increase the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.25 per cent. \"The upturn in the Norwegian economy has gained a firm footing. Several other central banks have raised their key rates. The consideration of stabilising activity and inflation somewhat further ahead suggests that the key policy rate should be raised”, says Governor Øystein Olsen. Inflation is low. This suggests that the key policy rate should be kept low. On the other hand, capacity utilisation in the economy is rising. There are prospects that inflation will pick up over the year ahead. “The analyses published in March suggested that the key policy rate should be raised gradually towards a more normal level. Developments since then have been approximately as expected. An overall assessment indicates that the key policy rate should be raised now”, says Olsen. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment and “The Executive Board’s assessment” in the March 2011 Monetary Policy Report. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent. The Executive Board’s current assessment is that the key policy rate should be increased before the end of the first half-year of 2011. The upturn in the Norwegian economy has gained a firm footing and market interest rates abroad have risen. There are prospects of relatively high growth in output and employment in the years ahead. Inflation is projected to gradually pick up towards the target of 2.5 per cent. “The projections in the March 2011 Monetary Policy Report imply that the interest rate should gradually be raised towards a more normal level”, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad.   “Should economic activity or inflation rise more than expected, the increase in the key policy rate may be more pronounced than currently envisaged. In the event of a marked slowdown in world economic growth, heightened financial turbulence abroad or a further appreciation of the krone, the increase in the key policy rate could be deferred further ahead”, says Qvigstad.    The Executive Board has decided that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1¾ −2¾ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 22 June 2011 unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.   For further information, see “The Executive Board’s assessment” in the March 2011 Monetary Policy Report (pdf) Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent. “Underlying inflation is around 1½ per cent, approximately as projected. Both the consideration of bringing consumer price inflation up to target and the consideration of stabilising developments in output and employment imply a low key policy rate”, says Governor Øystein Olsen. Activity in the global economy is increasing and commodity prices are rising, but the outlook for Europe remains highly uncertain. Interest rates abroad have risen since October, but are still low. In Norway, the rise in house prices and consumer spending have picked up. The consideration of guarding against the risk of future financial imbalances that may disturb activity and inflation somewhat further ahead suggests that the key policy rate should not be kept low for too long. On the other hand, a strong krone may lead to inflation becoming too low. “An overall assessment of the outlook and the balance of risks suggests that the key policy rate be left unchanged at this meeting”, says Governor Olsen. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent. ”Underlying inflation has been approximately as projected and is now around 1½ per cent. Growth in the Norwegian economy has picked up as expected. Contacts in our regional network confirm that capacity utilisation is increasing, but that the level of activity is probably still somewhat lower than normal. Growth has been unexpectedly high among several of Norway’s most important trading partners. In addition, equity prices are holding up and oil prices have risen. On the other hand, uncertainty regarding developments in Europe persists. Central bank key rates abroad are expected to remain low for some time. An overall assessment suggests that the key policy rate be left unchanged at this meeting”, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. ”The consideration of guarding against the risk of future financial imbalances that may disturb activity and inflation somewhat further ahead suggests that the key policy rate should not be kept low for too long”, says Qvigstad. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent. “Consumer price inflation has been lower than expected and inflation is projected to remain at around 1½ per cent in the period to summer 2011. At the same time, growth in the Norwegian economy is continuing at a moderate pace”, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. The outlook for the world economy is still highly uncertain. The expected upward shift in key rates abroad has been deferred further ahead and long-term interest rates are very low. “An overall assessment suggests that the key policy rate be kept unchanged at this meeting”, says Gjedrem. The analyses presented in the October Monetary Policy Report indicate that the key policy rate should be held at the current level over the coming quarters and then gradually raised towards a more normal level. Developments since June suggest that the interest rate should be raised somewhat later than projected in the June Report. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1½–2½ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 16 March 2011 unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment. Charts and background material      Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent. “In Norway, inflation is low and somewhat below the central bank’s target of 2.5 per cent.  Activity is increasing in the Norwegian economy, although there is still some margin of spare capacity. Interest rates in other countries are low. On balance, these factors suggest that the interest rate should be kept unchanged at 2 per cent”, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad.  Activity among some of Norway’s most important trading partners increased more than expected in the first half of the year and growth in Asia remains high. However, growth prospects in the US have been lowered. Slightly slower growth is also likely in the euro area ahead. Financial markets have stabilised somewhat after the turbulence before summer, but are still marked by uncertainty. The low interest rate level in Norway has not triggered an increase in household debt growth so far and the rise in house prices is moderate.  “The consideration of guarding against the risk of future financial imbalances that may disturb activity and inflation somewhat further ahead nonetheless suggests that the interest rate should be gradually brought closer to a more normal level”, says Qvigstad. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent. “Recent developments in the Norwegian economy have been broadly in line with expectations.  Activity is rising moderately.  Inflation has slowed and is now below 2 per cent,” says Governor Svein Gjedrem. Global economic growth has been slightly stronger than expected, but the level of activity is still low in advanced economies. Turbulence related to public finances in several European countries has receded, but the outlook for the US economy is somewhat more uncertain. “Considerations relating to both inflation and stable developments in output and employment imply that the interest rate should be kept low. The consideration of guarding against the risk of future financial imbalances that may disturb activity and inflation somewhat further ahead suggests that the interest rate should be gradually brought closer to a more normal level,” says Gjedrem. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 2 per cent. “The moderate recovery in the Norwegian economy is continuing, and inflation has moved broadly in line with projections. However, the turmoil in global financial markets is creating uncertainty with regard to economic developments. This suggests that the interest rate should be kept unchanged for a period and that the further increase will occur later than previously envisaged”, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. “The outlook for Europe is uncertain. Many countries are compelled to implement substantial fiscal tightening. This will dampen economic activity and may have an impact on other countries, both within and outside Europe. The projections in Monetary Policy Report 2/10, presented today, are based on the assumption that the turmoil in financial markets will gradually pass. Interest rates abroad are nonetheless expected to remain low for a fairly long period”, says Qvigstad. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1½–2½ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 27 October unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment. Charts and background material     Press release The key policy rate increased to 2 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to increase the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2 per cent. “Inflation has moved in line with projections and growth in the Norwegian economy appears to have picked up as anticipated. This suggests that the interest rate should be raised further towards a more normal level,” says Governor Svein Gjedrem. Underlying inflation is now around 2 per cent and is likely to edge down further in the period to summer. “As the activity level increases and the effects of the krone appreciation unwind, inflation is expected to move up again” says the Governor. The global economy is rebounding. Oil prices and other commodity prices have increased. A loan agreement between Greece, euro area countries and the IMF has been concluded, but government securities markets remain turbulent. Developments in Europe may prove to be weaker than expected, which may also affect the outlook for the Norwegian economy. “The Executive Board therefore considered the alternative of leaving the key policy rate unchanged at this meeting,” says Governor Svein Gjedrem. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate remains unchanged at 1.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent. - We decided to keep the interest rate unchanged at today’s meeting. Inflation and the level of activity may for a period be somewhat lower than anticipated. The analyses presented today indicate that the key policy rate should be raised gradually, but somewhat later than expected in autumn, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad.   - According to the Bank’s regional network, output is rising, but growth is not high and some industries are still in decline, says Qvigstad. Growth is strong in Asia, but the upswing in Europe is only moderate.  Interest rate expectations abroad have fallen markedly and the interest rate differential against other countries has widened since autumn. As a result, the krone is stronger than expected.  Combined with prospects for lower wage growth, this will exert downward pressure on inflation further ahead in 2010. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1½-2½ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 23 June unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate remains unchanged at 1.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 1.75 per cent. Since the October Monetary Policy Report developments in the Norwegian economy have been broadly in line with projections. The recovery in Norway and abroad has taken hold, and Norges Bank has raised the key rate in two increments to 1.75 per cent. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key rate should be in the interval 1¼ - 2¼ per cent until the publication of the next report in March.   – We have chosen to keep the key policy rate unchanged at this meeting, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. Inflation is now slightly below 2.5 per cent. Activity is rising, but there are still available resources in the Norwegian economy. House price inflation is high and household demand is increasing. Exports appear to be picking up somewhat faster than expected. On the other hand, petroleum investment may be lower than projected. – Unemployment is relatively low, but both employment and the labour force have decreased somewhat further than anticipated, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. The world economy is rebounding but activity is low and unemployment is high in the US and in Europe. Growth is holding up in emerging economies, but is likely to be moderate in the US and Europe. Key rates are close to zero in many countries and are expected to remain low for some time ahead. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment Charts and background material    Press release Key policy rate increased to 1.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to increase the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.75 per cent. - Activity in the Norwegian economy has picked up and inflation is close to 2.5 per cent. Growth has revived in the US and in most European countries. Activity continues to increase in Asia. On the whole, the upturn abroad and in Norway has, as expected, gained a firmer foothold and the outlook for next year seems less uncertain. The Executive Board has therefore decided to raise the key policy rate now, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. Growth in private consumption is strong and house prices are rising sharply. The level of unemployment remains relatively low. On the other hand, corporate and petroleum investment may fall somewhat more sharply than expected. The global economy is recovering, but prospects remain uncertain, particularly in countries with large government deficits. - The Executive Board considered the alternative of keeping the key policy rate unchanged, but interest rates are low and the October increase in the key policy rate has had a limited impact on bank lending rates. On the basis of an overall assessment, the Executive Board decided to increase the key policy rate at this monetary policy meeting. The Board still holds the view that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1¼ - 2¼ per cent in the period to end-March, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. For further information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment” Charts and background material      Press release Key policy rate increased to 1.50 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to increase the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.50 per cent. - Inflation has been slightly higher than expected. Unemployment is considerably lower than previously projected. The global economy is in a deep downturn, but there are signs of renewed growth. Activity in the Norwegian economy has picked up more rapidly than expected. The Executive Board considered the alternative of increasing the key policy rate at the previous monetary policy meeting. Developments indicate that it is appropriate to raise the key policy rate now, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1¼ - 2¼ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 24 March 2010, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks. - The analyses in Monetary Policy Report 3/09 indicate that the key policy rate should thereafter be raised gradually, says Governor Gjedrem.  For further information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment” and Monetary Policy Report 3/09. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 1.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 1.25 per cent. - Inflation is now below the target of 2.5 per cent. The krone has appreciated and will, in conjunction with continued low imported inflation, contribute to keeping inflation below target in the year ahead. There is still a risk of continued low growth in the global economy for a fairly long period ahead. Key rates in many countries are close to zero and global money market rates have fallen. Hence, it is now appropriate to keep the key policy rate unchanged, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad.  The Norwegian economy has fared well through the financial crisis. High activity in the oil industry and monetary and fiscal policy measures have contributed to supporting demand for goods and services. Employment is stable and it appears that unemployment will be considerably lower than expected, despite the decline in manufacturing and the building and construction industry.  - The Executive Board considered the alternative of increasing the key policy rate at today’s meeting, says Qvigstad. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”. Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 1.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 1.25 per cent. - Inflation is approximately in line with that expected.  Underlying inflation is close to the inflation target of 2.5 per cent. Unemployment has been lower than projected and the financial market situation has improved. It is nonetheless too early to determine whether the business cycle has turned. On the whole, developments do not at present warrant a change in the interest rate, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. The global recession is affecting the Norwegian economy, but the impact on Norway has been less severe than in many other countries. Activity has fallen at a slower rate in the US and Europe. There are also signs of growth in several countries. But even though the situation in the global economy now seems to be stabilising, experience indicates that new shocks can quickly trigger a reversal.  - It appears that output and employment in Norway may slow somewhat less sharply than expected. New figures may change the picture, but should these developments continue, it may be appropriate to increase the interest rate earlier than projected in the previous Monetary Policy Report, says Svein Gjedrem. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”.  Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate reduced by 0.25 percentage point to 1.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.25 per cent with effect from 18 June 2009. - We have made substantial cuts in the interest rate in response to the challenges generated by the crisis. The key policy rate has been reduced by 4½ percentage points since September.  It seems likely that domestic output will gradually pick up again, but inflation is expected to slow to around 1½ per cent in the coming year, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. Norges Bank’s projections are approximately the same as in March, and the analysis in Monetary Policy Report 2/09 indicates that the key policy rate can remain close to 1 per cent for a period ahead. The global economic downturn continues. Activity is also contracting in Norway and unemployment is rising. - Uncertainty with regard to developments ahead is still high. So far, the fall in global activity has been more pronounced than expected.  Confidence indicators for the corporate and household sectors nevertheless indicate that the fall in activity is moderating both in Norway and abroad. The functioning of financial markets has also improved somewhat, says Qvigstad. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment” and Monetary Policy Report 2/09.  Charts and background material     Press release Key policy rate reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 1.50 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce the key policy rate by 0.50 percentage point to 1.50 per cent with effect from 7 May 2009.  - New information has confirmed that the current global economic downturn is the deepest in the post-war period. If anything, developments have been weaker than expected, but there are also some signs of improvement. In order to mitigate the impact on the Norwegian economy, it is appropriate to reduce the key policy rate further, says Governor of Norges Bank Svein Gjedrem. The global recession is having an adverse impact on the Norwegian economy. Developments since the March monetary policy meeting have been approximately as expected. Production continues to decline and unemployment is rising. Inflation is slowing. Lower inflation abroad and lower capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy will exert further downward pressure on inflation ahead. - We are setting the key policy rate at a low level in order to curb the decline in activity and prevent inflation from falling too far, says Gjedrem. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”, attached to the press release.  Charts and background material    Press release Key policy rate reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 2.00 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce its key policy rate by 0.50 percentage point to 2.00 per cent.  - The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated. In order to mitigate the impact in Norway, the interest rate is being reduced, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. The interest rate forecast has been lowered. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1-2 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 17 June 2009, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks. The analysis in Monetary Policy Report 1/09 suggests that the key policy rate may move down towards 1 per cent in the course of the autumn. It appears that the decline in activity in the Norwegian economy will be more pronounced than previously assumed. The enterprises in Norges Bank’s regional network are expecting output and employment to fall further over the next six months. Unemployment is still low, but is rising rapidly. - In order to cushion the decline in activity and prevent inflation from falling too far, it is appropriate to set the interest rate at a low level, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”, attached to the press release.  Charts and background material    Press release Key policy rate reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 2.50 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce its key policy rate by 0.50 percentage point to 2.50 per cent.  – Global economic growth has weakened further since December. The international downturn seems to be having a broad impact and is likely to be deeper than previously expected, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. The decrease in interest rates and the new fiscal measures will curb the effect of the international downturn on output and employment in Norway. Inflation has moderated as expected. There are prospects that inflation may continue to ease somewhat, but will remain close to 2.5 per cent. Expectations of low and stable inflation now make it possible to use monetary policy actively. There is still considerable uncertainty surrounding developments ahead. The downturn in the Norwegian economy may be deeper and more prolonged than Norges Bank has assumed. Inflation may in turn become too low. This would then indicate that the interest rate should be cut further. On the other hand, the key policy rate has already been reduced considerably. It will take time for the effects of the new, lower interest rate level to become evident. This may in isolation indicate that developments should be monitored over a period before making substantial changes to the key rate. – The outlook for the Norwegian economy and the balance of risks suggest that it is now appropriate to reduce the key policy rate by 0.50 percentage point to 2.50 per cent, says Svein Gjedrem. For further information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”, attached to the press release.  Background material    Press release Key policy rate set at 3.00 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce its key policy rate by 1.75 percentage points to 3.00 per cent with effect from 18 December 2008. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key policy rate should lie in the interval 2-3 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 25 March 2009, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks.  - Since the end of October international and domestic growth prospects have weakened considerably. At the same time, inflation is subsiding faster than expected. An overall assessment suggests that it is appropriate to lower the key policy rate considerably at this juncture. The credibility of the inflation target now makes it possible to use monetary policy actively to dampen the impact of the financial crisis on the Norwegian economy, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. The world economy is experiencing a pronounced cyclical downturn. Key policy rates have been lowered substantially abroad. Oil prices have continued to fall. It appears that economic growth in Norway will also be markedly lower than anticipated in October. According to new information from Norges Bank’s regional network, production and employment are expected to fall in the coming quarters. Inflation is moving down. On the other hand, the krone exchange rate has been weaker than expected. The low value of the krone is helping to mitigate the effects of the international downturn on the Norwegian economy.  - The risk of a pronounced downturn in the Norwegian economy has increased. At the same time, the risk that inflation will become too high ahead has been reduced. The dual consideration of stabilising inflation around the inflation target and stabilising developments in output and employment suggests a markedly lower interest rate, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. For further information, see \"The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment” and ”New interest rate projections” attached to the press release.  Background material    Press release Key policy rate reduced by 0.50 percentage point to 4.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce its key policy rate by 0.50 percentage point to 4.75 per cent with effect from 30 October 2008. – The effects of the financial crisis will most likely be more pronounced than envisaged only recently. The slowdown in the Norwegian economy appears to be occurring rapidly and is likely to be pronounced, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. Prices have increased markedly since autumn 2007, but the outlook suggests that inflation may edge down ahead. The key policy rate forecast has been lowered. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key policy rate should lie in the interval 4% – 5% in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 25 March 2009, unless the economy is exposed to new major shocks. The krone exchange rate has depreciated substantially. Should the krone remain weak for a long period, inflation may remain high. Norges Bank is closely monitoring developments in the krone exchange rate. – There is now unusually high uncertainty surrounding economic developments ahead. An overall assessment of the outlook and the balance of risks suggests that it is now appropriate to reduce the key policy rate by 0.50 percentage point. Weight is given to moving forward the reduction in the key policy rate so that lending rates for households and businesses can gradually be reduced. As an alternative, the Executive Board considered reducing the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. For more information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”.   Charts and background material    Press release Key policy rate reduced by 0.5 percentage point to 5.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to reduce its key policy rate by 0.5 percentage point to 5.25 per cent with effect from 16 October 2008. – The crisis in international financial markets has deepened and will therefore have greater effects on the Norwegian economy than previously assumed, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. – Despite comprehensive measures by the authorities, the problems that arose in the US banking system have spread to most markets and countries, particularly after 15 September. Credit channels have dried up. The outlook for global economic growth next year has considerably worsened, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. The supply of capital has also declined in Norway and it is more expensive and to some extent more difficult for banks, enterprises and households to obtain funding. Banks have increased their lending rates. Inflation remains high, but the forces that have fuelled inflation have now diminished. – There is unusually high uncertainty surrounding developments ahead, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. It is difficult to comment on the likelihood of different outcomes. The most robust approach may therefore now be to implement measures to reduce the uncertainty and stave off particularly adverse outcomes for the economy. This implies a more active monetary policy than normal, both in interest rate-setting and through liquidity policy measures. – The Norwegian authorities have implemented a broad range of measures to address the situation in money and credit markets. Norges Bank is monitoring developments closely and will continue to supply krone and dollar liquidity when it is appropriate to do so, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. The monetary policy meeting on 29 October will proceed as planned, and the Board will then also take a stand on the strategy ahead for the key policy rate. For more information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment. Charts and background material    Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 5.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to maintain its key policy rate unchanged at 5.75 per cent. – There is now an unusually high degree of uncertainty linked to the turbulence in financial markets. There are wide daily swings in money market rates, equity prices, the krone exchange rate and oil and commodity prices. It is difficult to determine how long this pressure will last and the effects on inflation and activity in the Norwegian economy. It is therefore appropriate to keep the interest rate unchanged now, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad.– Norges Bank is following developments closely and providing liquidity in both Norwegian kroner and US dollars to curb the swings in the Norwegian money market.  Inflation has picked up markedly since autumn 2007. Underlying inflation now seems to be a little less than 3½ per cent. This is higher than expected and well above the inflation target of 2.5 per cent. Wages are rising rapidly and productivity growth seems to be slackening faster than previously assumed. At the same time, the krone exchange rate has weakened. There are prospects that inflation may remain high over a period ahead. On the other hand, the crisis in financial markets has deepened. The risk of a long economic downturn abroad has increased. In Norway, there are also clear signs that economic growth is slowing. At the same time, the difference between money market rates and the key policy rate has widened as a result of the financial market turbulence, and the cost of corporate and household borrowing has increased. For more information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment. Charts and background material    Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 5.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to maintain its key policy rate unchanged at 5.75 per cent. - Inflation is rising. Underlying inflation was higher than expected in July and now appears to be close to 3½ per cent, says Governor Svein Gjedrem.  Capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is still high and the labour market is tight. On the other hand, growth in the world economy is slowing markedly. New figures that have become available through summer indicate in particular a rapid slowdown in Europe. As expected, there are also signs of slower growth in the Norwegian economy. The analysis in the Monetary Policy Report published in June indicated that the key policy rate will remain at the current level, or perhaps somewhat higher, in the coming year. - New information does not provide a basis for departing from the strategy set out in June, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. For more information, see The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment.   Charts and background material    Press release Key policy rate raised to 5.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to raise the key policy rate to 5.75 per cent.  “Inflation has been slightly higher than expected and there are prospects that inflation will move up further. We give weight to preventing the higher rate of inflation from becoming entrenched. It is therefore appropriate to raise the interest rate now”, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. “The upturn in Norway is entering a new phase. Inflation has been low and growth high for a long period. It now appears that inflation will be somewhat higher and that growth will be lower”, says Qvigstad. The analysis in Monetary Policy Report 2/08 indicates that the key policy rate will remain at the current level, or perhaps somewhat higher, in the coming year. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key policy rate should be in the interval 5¼ - 6¼ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 29 October, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to major shocks. “Even though growth is moderating both in Norway and abroad, activity in the Norwegian economy will remain high for a period ahead. Unemployment is at a historically low level, inflation is picking up and wages are rising rapidly”, says Jan F. Qvigstad.  For more information, see the attached document “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”.  Charts and background material      Press release Key policy rate unchanged at 5.50 per cent Norges Bank's Executive Board decided today to maintain its key policy rate unchanged at 5.50 per cent.  - Inflation has increased over the past six months and underlying inflation is now somewhat higher than 2.5 per cent, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. Capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy is still high, but as expected there are signs that economic growth is moderating. Growth in household spending is slowing. Building starts have declined. Developments in the global economy are divergent, but there are lower growth prospects. Rising energy and food prices are fuelling inflation in many countries, and interest rate expectations abroad have increased. The strategy in Monetary Policy Report 1/08 is that the key policy rate should be in the interval 5 – 6 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 25 June, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to major shocks.  - The increase in inflation and the prospect of higher inflation suggest a further increase in the key policy rate.  Against the background of the turbulence in financial markets, high premiums in the money market and uncertainty about the global economic outlook, it is nevertheless appropriate to leave the key policy rate unchanged now, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. For more information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”. Charts and background material    Press release Key policy rate raised to 5.50 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to increase the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 5.50 per cent. - Inflation is moving up. Various measures of inflation are slightly divergent, but on the whole underlying inflation is close to 2.5 per cent, says Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad. Capacity utilisation is high, and the labour market remains tight. The first wage settlements indicate as expected that wage growth is picking up. House prices have risen again after declining for several months. Oil prices remain high. The krone depreciated in March, but appreciated again in April. On the other hand, the US economy is weak. Financial markets are still turbulent and global economic growth may turn out to be weaker than previously assumed.  The strategy in Monetary Policy Report 1/08 is that the key policy rate should be in the interval 5 – 6 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 25 June, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to major shocks.  - New information since the previous monetary policy meeting does not on balance warrant a deviation from this strategy. Higher interest rates will contribute to a gradual decline in capacity utilisation, so that inflation does not become too high, says Jan F. Qvigstad.   For more information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”. Charts and background material    Press release Norges Bank leaves key policy rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to maintain its key policy rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent. - Inflation has picked up markedly in recent months. Various measures of inflation show somewhat different developments, but on the whole underlying inflation is close to 2.5 per cent. Inflation is expected to move up one to two years ahead. Growth in the Norwegian economy is high, employment is rising and wage growth is picking up, says Governor Svein Gjedrem.   On the other hand, the outlook for the global economy has weakened. Interest rates have shifted down in the US and a number of other countries. The krone has appreciated. The analyses in Monetary Policy Report 1/08 suggest that the key policy rate may be raised further in the period to summer. - The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key rate should be in the interval 5 – 6 per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 25 June, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to major shocks. We have considered raising the key rate as an alternative, but an overall assessment indicates that it is appropriate to keep the interest rate unchanged now, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. For more information, see “The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision – background and general assessment”. Charts and background material    Press release Norges Bank leaves key policy rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to maintain its key policy rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent. – Consumer prices have increased at a faster pace than expected and growth in the Norwegian economy remains strong. At the same time, the growth outlook for the world economy has weakened, says Deputy Governor Jarle Bergo. CPI inflation moved up to 2.8 per cent in December, partly reflecting high electricity prices. Other inflation measures ranged between 1¾ and 2½ per cent, which was also higher than expected. Because many businesses normally change selling prices at the beginning of the year, price developments in January and February will provide a better indication of the rate of increase in prices. Employment has increased markedly and faster than expected. Private consumption has also been higher than projected. On the other hand, weaker growth among our trading partners will normally have an adverse impact on the Norwegian economy. In particular, developments in the US have been weaker than expected and the US Federal Reserve has reduced its key rate markedly. There has been a considerable downward shift in global interest rate expectations in recent weeks. The growth outlook for the world economy has weakened and equity prices have declined. House prices have fallen in several countries, including Norway.   - Inflation picked up faster than expected in December and growth in the Norwegian economy is strong, but in view of the weak developments in the external environment and the turbulence in financial markets, it is now on balance appropriate to leave the key policy rate unchanged, says Deputy Governor Jarle Bergo. For more information, see \"The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision - background and general assessment\".  Charts and background material    Press release Norges Bank raises key policy rate to 5.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to raise its key policy rate (sight deposit rate) by 0.25 percentage point to 5.25 per cent with effect from 13 December 2007. – Inflation is low but rising, and this is why we are raising the key policy rate. Growth in the Norwegian economy has been stronger than expected. Demand for labour is rising rapidly, and household consumption has increased more than expected, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. Since the beginning of November, the turbulence in money and credit markets has heightened and the outlook for the world economy has become more uncertain. House prices in Norway have fallen this autumn. Short-term money market rates are considerably higher than expectations concerning key rates would imply. These factors suggest that the key policy rate should be kept unchanged. On the other hand, the Executive Board gave weight to faster-than-projected growth in the Norwegian economy. Demand for labour is rising rapidly. Household consumption has increased more rapidly than expected. Norges Bank’s regional network confirms the picture of continued solid growth in the economy. In addition, the Norwegian krone has depreciated somewhat against most currencies.  Consumer price inflation has picked up markedly as a result of a sharp increase in electricity prices, and is expected to show a further rise. In the October Monetary Policy Report, the rise in underlying consumer price inflation was expected to pick up gradually to around 2 per cent in the latter half of 2008.  - Keeping the key policy rate unchanged was considered as an alternative, but on balance the Board judges that it is now appropriate to raise the key policy rate. A higher interest rate may gradually reduce capacity utilisation, so that inflation will not become too high, says Governor Svein Gjedrem. For more information, see \"The Executive Board’s monetary policy decision - background and general assessment\".  Charts and background material    Press release Norges Bank leaves the key policy rate unchanged Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to leave its key policy rate unchanged. Norges Bank's key policy rate (sight deposit rate) thus remains at 5.00 per cent. Underlying inflation has picked up, but is lower than the inflation target. Various measures of underlying inflation are now between 1½% and 2%. Growth in the Norwegian economy remains strong and stronger than projected earlier. Capacity utilisation is high. Wage growth is on the rise and there are prospects of higher inflation. At the same time, the krone has appreciated markedly and there are prospects that somewhat weaker growth in the world economy will contribute to curbing inflation and growth in output and employment in Norway. Moreover, money market rates have risen more than market expectations concerning the key policy rate would imply in the short term. The analysis in this Report implies that the key policy rate should be increased further, but to a lesser extent than envisaged in June. A higher interest rate will gradually reduce capacity utilisation so that inflation will not become too high. The Executive Board’s strategy is that the key policy rate should be in the interval 4¾ – 5¾% in the period to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on 13 March 2008, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to major shocks. Given the inflation target, we will be mindful of the effects of higher interest rates on the krone exchange rate when inflation is low. The projections are uncertain. New information may reveal aspects of economic developments that indicate that the Norwegian economy is moving on a different path than projected. On the one hand, high capacity utilisation and higher cost inflation may lead to higher-than-projected inflation. On the other hand, the risk of slower growth in the world economy has increased. If growth in the world economy turns out to be weaker or the krone stronger than projected, inflation may be lower than projected in this Report. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information since the previous monetary policy meeting on 26 September:  Growth in the US economy has slackened and there are signs of somewhat slower growth in western Europe. Growth is strong in emerging economies, particularly China, India and Russia. Turbulence in international money and credit markets has persisted. Many central banks have continued to provide an ample supply of liquidity into money markets. In Norway, interest rates on loans with maturities longer than one week also remain substantially higher than market expectations concerning the key policy rate. It appears that banks’ lending rates this autumn have been raised more than the key rate. Market expectations as to central banks’ key rates have been lowered in Norway and abroad. The central bank in Sweden has raised its key rate by 0.25 percentage point. Equity prices are generally somewhat higher than at end-September. The spot price of Brent Blend oil is now about USD 89 per barrel, an increase of USD 11 since the previous monetary policy meeting. The increase is lower measured in other currencies. A weighted average of Statoil and Hydro’s selling price for gas showed a slight rise from the second to the third quarter. Total petroleum production on the Norwegian continental shelf fell by about 6 per cent in the period January to August compared with the same period a year earlier. After a substantial appreciation of the krone exchange rate through summer, the import-weighted krone exchange rate appreciated further by about 0.3 per cent. Owing to the decline in electricity prices, overall inflation is low. The year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) was -0.3 per cent in September. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, consumer prices (CPI-ATE) rose by 1.6 per cent over the past twelve months, down from 1.8 per cent in August. The rise in prices measured by a trimmed mean of the rise in the sub-indices in the CPI was 1.6 per cent in September, while a weighted median showed a rise of 1.8 per cent. According to External Trade Statistics, prices for traditional export goods fell by 1.7 per cent in the year to the third quarter. Import prices for goods, excluding energy products, rose by 3.4 per cent in the same period. In September, seasonally adjusted registered unemployment stood at 1.8 per cent of the labour force, about the same as in the previous month. As measured by Statistics Norway’s labour force survey (LFS), seasonally adjusted unemployment was 2.5 per cent in July (three-month period June-August). Employment increased by 7 000 between June and July, while the labour force expanded by 8 000 in the same period. Manufacturing production increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent in the period June-August compared with the previous three-month period. Statistics Norway’s business tendency survey for manufacturing showed a continued rise in production volume, order backlogs and employment in the third quarter. Gross domestic debt in the enterprise sector was 21.1 per cent higher in August than at the same time last year. Enterprises’ liquid assets rose by 26.7 per cent in the same period. Commercial property starts in square metres rose by 22 per cent in the first eight months of this year compared with the same period one year earlier. According to the financial accounts, household net lending was a negative NOK 79.0 billion over the four quarters to the second quarter of this year. Household net financial assets nonetheless rose by NOK 59.3 billion in the same period as a result of securities gains and changes in the basis of measurement for securities. Twelve-month growth in household gross domestic debt was 12.0 per cent at the end of August. Household spending on goods rose by 7.7 per cent in the year to August 2007. House price statistics from the real estate industry show that the seasonally adjusted monthly rise in house prices slowed for the third consecutive month in September. The twelve-month rise was 7.6 per cent in September, down from 9.2 per cent in August. The number of housing starts is lower than earlier this year. According to the consultancy firm ECON Pöyry, both the turnover rate and the numbers of new dwellings sold in south-eastern Norway were lower in September and October than in the previous two-month period. Charts and background material    Press release Norges Bank increases the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 5.00 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to raise its key policy rate (sight deposit rate) by 0.25 percentage point to 5.00 per cent with effect from 27 September 2007. Prices for many goods and services have increased at a faster pace in recent months. Underlying inflation has for some time been projected at between 1½ and 2 per cent in the latter half of this year. Various measures of underlying inflation have so far increased broadly in line with projections. Prices for domestically produced goods and services have in particular risen at a fast pace. Growth in the economy has been stronger than expected. Cost inflation is on the rise and there are prospects of a further pick-up in price inflation. These conditions suggest that the interest rate should be increased. On the other hand, financial markets have been turbulent since the beginning of August and the global economic outlook is uncertain. The krone is strong. Given the inflation target, we will be mindful of the effects of higher interest rates on the krone exchange rate when inflation is low. The Executive Board considered the alternative of leaving the key policy rate unchanged at today’s meeting. According to the strategy in Monetary Policy Report 2/07, the key policy rate should be in the interval 4½ - 5½ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 31 October, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. The interest rate will be increased gradually so that we can assess the effects of interest rate changes and other new information on economic developments. If the turmoil in financial markets persists and the krone remains strong, and this has considerable consequences for the outlook for inflation, output and employment, Norges Bank’s key policy rate may be raised to a lesser extent than envisaged in June. Outlook and risk factorsIn Monetary Policy Report 2/07, inflation measured by the CPI was projected to pick up markedly next year from a very low level this year. Inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was projected to pick up more gradually. Capacity utilisation is currently at such a high level that inflation is projected to gradually move up to 2.5 per cent. At the same time, the increase in interest rates will lead to a gradual fall in capacity utilisation so that inflation does not become too high. New information may reveal aspects of economic developments that indicate that the Norwegian economy is moving on a different path than projected. In Monetary Policy Report 2/07, it was pointed out that high capacity utilisation and higher cost inflation may on the one hand lead to higher-than-projected inflation. Sustained high productivity growth, a more pronounced shift towards imports from low-cost countries and a stronger krone exchange rate may on the other hand result in lower-than-expected inflation. Cost inflation is now on the rise as a result of higher wage growth. Moreover, productivity growth in the business sector seems to be easing. The rise in prices for imported goods, which tend to show monthly variations, has been somewhat lower than expected and the krone is now strong. Growth in household consumption, investment, employment and the supply of labour has been stronger than projected. At the same time, there are as expected signs of slower growth in the housing market and some segments of the construction sector. Our regional network confirms the picture of sustained solid growth in the Norwegian economy, but there are signs that the pace of growth may soften ahead as a result of capacity constraints. The turbulence in financial markets may imply weaker developments both in the US and Europe. The financial sector in several countries has been affected. Economic developmentsThe Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information since the previous monetary policy meeting on 15 August: Losses linked to defaults on US subprime mortgage loans have led to an increase in risk premia in credit and bond markets. There are fears of losses at banks and finance companies in both the US and Europe. Banks have become more reluctant to extend loans to one another. Extraordinary injections of central bank liquidity have contributed to keeping the shortest money market rates at normal levels, but only for terms of less than one week. The risk associated with interbank lending now seems to be perceived as higher, and money market rates with longer maturities have increased in the US, the euro area, the UK and Sweden. Norwegian money market rates with slightly longer maturities have also risen.  Global growth prospects have weakened as a result of the turmoil in financial markets. The US labour market has weakened. There are prospects of lower growth in the US and Europe. Economic growth in emerging economies remains strong, particularly in China. The central banks in Sweden and Switzerland have raised their official interest rates by 0.25 percentage point, and the central bank in China has raised its key rate by 0.27 percentage point. The Federal Reserve has cut its key rate by 0.50 percentage point. Interest rate expectations have decreased abroad and at home. Equity prices have fluctuated, but are on the whole somewhat higher than in mid-August. Oil prices have increased in US dollar terms. The spot price of Brent Blend oil is now about USD 78 per barrel. Norwegian petroleum production declined by about 5 per cent in the period January-July this year compared with the same period one year earlier. The import-weighted krone exchange rate has appreciated by about 2.8 per cent since the previous monetary policy meeting and by about 3.4 per cent since the publication of Monetary Policy Report 2/07. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index (CPI) was 0.4 per cent in August, unchanged on June and July. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, the rate of increase in consumer prices (CPI-ATE) was 1.8 per cent over the past twelve months, up from 1.4 per cent in July. The rise in prices measured by a trimmed mean of the rise in the sub-indices in the CPI was 1.5 per cent in August, while a weighted median showed a rise of 1.6 per cent. According to preliminary quarterly national accounts figures, GDP for mainland Norway increased by a seasonally adjusted 1.3 per cent between first and second quarter. Excluding electricity production, growth was 1.0 per cent. First-quarter growth was revised up by 0.2 percentage point to 1.6 per cent and to 1.5 per cent excluding electricity production. According to preliminary figures from Statistics Norway’s wage index for the second quarter of this year, average growth in monthly wages was 5.8 per cent from the second quarter of 2006 to the second quarter of this year. In August, seasonally adjusted registered unemployment stood at 1.8 per cent of the labour force, 0.1 percentage point lower than in July. As measured by Statistics Norway’s labour force survey (LFS), seasonally adjusted unemployment was 2.5 per cent in June (three-month period May-July). Employment increased by 5 000 between May and June, while the labour force expanded by 4 000 in the same period. Manufacturing production increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in the period May-July compared with the previous three-month period. In the investment intentions survey for the third quarter of this year, manufacturing investment for this year was estimated at NOK 27.7 billion at current prices. Compared with the estimates for 2006, the survey indicates growth of 30 per cent this year. The value of new orders in manufacturing was 18 per cent higher in the second quarter of this year than in the same period one year earlier. The same comparison for the stock of orders shows an increase of 44 per cent. According to investment intentions survey for oil and gas production, including pipeline transport, total investment for 2007 is estimated at NOK 117.5 billion at current prices. This implies value growth of 23 per cent between 2006 and 2007. Investment for 2008 is now estimated at NOK 119.2 billion, which is the highest estimate published since the survey started in 1985.  According to order statistics for the construction industry, the value of new orders increased by 20 per cent between the second quarter of 2006 and the second quarter of 2007. The value of the total stock of orders increased by 21.0 per cent in the same period. Norges Bank’s regional network reports continued solid growth in all industries, but growth seems to be somewhat lower than in spring. Market prospects for the coming six months indicate sustained solid growth. Several industries report that capacity constraints have limited growth and will continue to limit growth potential ahead. Estimates for annual wage growth this year have been adjusted upwards for all industries. Prices have risen at a brisk pace over the past twelve months, particularly in the construction industry and commercial services, and the rise in prices is the highest registered in the network. Fewer enterprises now expect prices to rise at a faster pace ahead. Profits are rising in all industries, but at a slower pace than earlier this year. Gross domestic debt of enterprises was 20.5 per cent higher in July than at the same time last year. The corresponding increase in the money supply was 26.1 per cent in the same period. Rental prices for Oslo’s most attractive commercial premises rose by almost 30 per cent in the first six months of the year. Commercial property starts in square metres rose by 18.4 per cent in the first seven months of this year compared with the same period one year earlier.  Twelve-month growth in household gross domestic debt was 12.3 per cent at the end of July, up from 12.0 per cent at end-June. TNS Gallup’s expectations survey, which measures households’ assessments and expectations concerning their financial situation and the Norwegian economy, showed a trend-adjusted decline between the second and third quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter of decline and the level is now on a par with that recorded in the third quarter of last year. Household spending on goods was 7.8 per cent higher in July than the same month one year earlier. House price statistics from the real estate industry show that the seasonally adjusted monthly rise in house prices slowed for the second consecutive month in August. The twelve-month rise was 9.2 per cent in August, down from 11.7 per cent in July. In the first seven months of the year, housing starts rose by 3.2 per cent compared with the same period one year earlier. Measured by utility floor space, the increase was 6.6 per cent in the same period.  Charts and background material    Press release Norges Bank increases the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to raise its key policy rate (sight deposit rate) by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75 per cent with effect from 16 August 2007. Consumer price inflation remains moderate, but there are prospects that inflation will gradually pick up. The interest rate is being raised so that inflation will not become too high. The interest rate will be increased gradually so that we can assess the effects of interest rate changes and other new information on economic developments. Recent credit and stock market turbulence has generated uncertainty concerning future economic developments, but on balance new information since the previous monetary policy meeting does not now warrant a departure from the monetary policy strategy presented in June. According to the strategy in Monetary Policy Report 2/07, the key policy rate should be in the interval 4½ - 5½ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 31 October, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. Given the inflation target, we will be mindful of the effects of higher interest rates on the krone exchange rate when inflation is low. Outlook and risk factors In Monetary Policy Report 2/07, inflation measured by the CPI was projected to pick up markedly next year from a very low level this year. Underlying inflation remains in the range between 1 per cent and 1½ per cent as it has for some time. The rise in the CPI adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) is expected to pick up to around 2 per cent in the latter half of 2008. Capacity utilisation is currently at such a high level that inflation is projected to gradually move up to 2.5 per cent. At the same time, the increase in interest rates will lead to a gradual fall in capacity utilisation so that inflation does not become too high. In the Report, it was noted that new information may reveal aspects of economic developments that indicate that the Norwegian economy is moving on a different path than projected. On the one hand, high capacity utilisation and higher cost inflation may lead to higher-than-projected inflation. On the other hand, sustained high productivity growth, a more pronounced shift towards imports from low-cost countries and a stronger krone exchange rate may result in lower-than-expected inflation. Since the publication of the previous Report, consumer price inflation has been somewhat lower than projected, primarily reflecting a lower-than-expected rise in prices with wide monthly variations. Growth in goods consumption, employment and the supply of labour has been stronger than projected. Financial markets have been very volatile. The weakness in the US housing market is still fuelling uncertainty about economic developments ahead. At the same time, growth is strong in China and India and there is an upturn in Europe. Moreover, growth in the international economy may be less dependent than earlier on demand for goods and services in the US. There is nevertheless a risk that uncertainty and volatility in financial markets will have spillover effects on growth in the world economy. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information since the previous monetary policy meeting on 27 June:Global growth remains high. Economic growth in China and India appears to be stronger than expected. The upturn in Europe is continuing even though euro-area growth was somewhat weaker than expected in the second quarter. In the US, the picture has been mixed and the US housing market has weakened. Developments in the US housing market have led to heightened uncertainty in credit and stock markets. Losses associated with defaults on subprime loans have increased risk premia in credit and bond markets. Equity prices have declined. Several central banks have injected extra liquidity into the banking system. Norges Bank provided liquidity to the Norwegian banking system through ordinary market operations on 9 August. The central banks in the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia have raised their official interest rates. In financial markets, short-term interest rate expectations have fallen, particularly in the US. Long-term interest rates have also declined. Interest rate expectations in Norway have fallen somewhat less. The spot price of Brent Blend oil is now about USD 70 per barrel. The futures price at end-2009 is USD 69 per barrel. A weighted average of Statoil and Hydro’s selling price for gas fell in the second quarter. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2006, the gas price has dropped by more than 20 per cent in NOK terms. According to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, Norwegian petroleum production shrank by a little more than 4 per cent in the period January-May this year compared with the same period one year earlier. Preliminary figures for June show a further drop in oil production due to planned maintenance at several fields.  The import-weighted krone exchange rate has appreciated by about 0.6 per cent. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index (CPI) was 0.4 per cent in July, unchanged on June. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, the rate of increase in consumer prices (CPI-ATE) was 1.4 per cent over the past twelve months. The rise in prices measured by a trimmed mean of the rise in the sub-indices in the CPI was 1.1 per cent, while a weighted median showed a rise of 1.5 per cent. External trade statistics show that prices for traditional export goods rose by 6.0 per cent between the second quarter of 2006 and the second quarter of this year. Import prices, excluding energy prices, rose by 9.0 per cent in the same period. In July, seasonally adjusted registered unemployment stood at 1.9 per cent of the labour force, unchanged on the previous month. As measured by Statistics Norway’s labour force survey (LFS), seasonally adjusted unemployment was 2.5 per cent in May (three-month period April-June). Employment increased by 19 000 persons on the previous three-month period (January-March), while the labour force expanded by 15 000 persons in the same period. Manufacturing production increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent from the first to the second quarter of this year. Statistics Norway’s business tendency survey for the second quarter of 2007 confirms a continued increase in production volume, stock of orders and manufacturing employment. Twelve-month growth in gross domestic debt of non-financial enterprises was 20.9 per cent at end-June, unchanged on May. The corresponding figure for the money supply was 26.1 per cent in June, down from 29.6 per cent at end-May. Household net borrowing was NOK 83.6 billion over the four quarters to the first quarter of this year. Household net assets still increased by NOK 8.6 billion in the same period as a result of price gains. Twelve-month growth in household gross domestic debt was 12.1 per cent at end-June, unchanged on May. Statistics Norway’s stock statistics show that dividends for households were considerably lower in 2006 than indicated by preliminary institutional sector accounts figures. The household saving ratio for 2006 may on this basis be recorded as negative for the first time since 1988. Household spending on goods increased by a seasonally adjusted 2.3 per cent in June, after rising by 1.0 per cent in the previous month (revised up from 0.4 per cent). Leisure articles, including boats, and clothing and footwear were among the goods that showed the strongest increase. The volume of retail sales, excluding motor vehicles and petrol, rose by 4.7 per cent in the same period adjusted for seasonal patterns, after falling by 0.4 per cent between April and May. Statistics from the real estate industry show that house prices edged down between June and July and were 11.3 per cent higher than in July 2006. According to building area statistics, housing starts rose by 18.5 per cent in the year to May 2007. Measured by utility floor space, the increase was 17.3 per cent. The year-on-year rise in the cost index for housing construction was 7.8 per cent in July, down from 7.9 per cent in June.  Charts and background material    Press release Norges Bank increases the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.50 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to raise its key policy rate (sight deposit rate) by 0.25 percentage point to 4.50 per cent with effect from 28 June 2007. Consumer price inflation remains moderate in spite of a prolonged cyclical upturn in the Norwegian economy. Underlying inflation has been relatively stable and ranged between 1 per cent and 1½ per cent for some time. There are nevertheless several factors indicating that inflation will pick up. Wage growth is rising and there are prospects that the economic expansion will last somewhat longer than previously envisaged. Employment is rising approximately as projected and unemployment is lower than during the previous expansion. There is a shortage of labour and certain important input factors in many industries. Temporarily low CPI inflation this year will be followed by temporarily high CPI inflation next year. Excluding energy prices, inflation is projected to rise at a more gradual pace, but the projections are uncertain. The interest rate path presented in Monetary Policy Report 2/07 reflects the Executive Board’s trade-off between bringing inflation up towards target and stabilising developments in output and employment. In the light of this trade-off, the interest rate will be increased gradually so that we can assess the effects of interest rate changes and other new information on economic developments. Given the inflation target, we will be mindful of the effects of higher interest rates on the krone exchange rate when inflation is low. The key policy rate was most recently raised in May. According to the strategy in Monetary Policy Report 2/07, the key policy rate should be in the interval 4½ - 5½ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 31 October, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. The Executive Board has concluded that it is appropriate to increase the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.50 per cent at today’s meeting. Outlook and risk factorsInflation measured by the CPI is projected to pick up markedly next year from a very low level this year. Electricity prices have declined from high levels in 2006 and contributed to a marked fall in CPI inflation. As a result of the prospect of high electricity prices early next year, CPI inflation may exceed 3 per cent in early 2008. The rise in the CPI adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) is expected to pick up to around 2 per cent in the latter half of 2008. Capacity utilisation is currently at such a high level that inflation will gradually move up to 2.5 per cent. At the same time, the increase in interest rates may lead to a gradual fall in capacity utilisation so that inflation does not become too high. Growth in the global economy remains robust. Inflation has edged up in some countries. Interest rate expectations abroad have increased markedly in recent months. The general rise in prices in the world economy has been low, but high commodity prices and lower resource availability engenders a risk of rising inflation. New information may reveal aspects of economic developments that indicate that the Norwegian economy is moving on a different path than projected. On the one hand, high capacity utilisation or higher cost inflation may lead to higher-than-projected inflation. On the other hand, sustained high productivity growth, a more pronounced shift towards imports from low-cost countries and a stronger krone exchange rate may result in lower-than-expected inflation. Economic developmentsThe Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information since the previous monetary policy meeting on 30 May: \r",
      " Interest rate expectations abroad have increased markedly in recent months. Growth in the global economy remains robust. Central banks in the euro area, Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland have raised their official interest rates. The tightening cycle might last somewhat longer in European countries than assumed earlier. Official interest rates in the US are no longer expected to be lowered. Interest rate expectations in Norway have also increased. Equity prices internationally and in Norway are approximately at the same level as around the previous monetary policy meeting. Long-term interest rates have increased markedly. The increase can be seen in connection with the abnormally low levels that prevailed for some time. Oil prices have increased somewhat. Futures prices at end-2008 are also somewhat higher than around the previous monetary policy meeting. The import-weighted krone exchange rate has appreciated by about 1¼ per cent. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index (CPI) was 0.3 per cent in May, unchanged from April. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, consumer price inflation (CPI-ATE) was 1.4 per cent in May. The twelve-month rise measured by both a trimmed mean of the rise in the sub-indices in the CPI and measured by a weighted median was 1.2 per cent in May. In May, seasonally adjusted registered unemployment was 1.9 per cent of the labour force, down by 0.1 percentage point on the previous month. AS measured by Statistics Norway’s labour force survey (LFS), seasonally adjusted unemployment was 2.7 per cent in March (three-month period February-April). In the same period, employment was unchanged, but the labour force grew by 1 000.  The manufacturing production index rose by 6.1 per cent in the year to April 2007. Statistics Norway’s investment intentions survey for manufacturing and the power industry indicates continued solid investment growth this year. In the investment intentions survey for oil and gas production, including pipeline transport, the estimate for total investment in 2007 was revised up in relation to the first-quarter survey. Corporate borrowing is still rising rapidly and the volume of enterprises’ liquid assets is high. Information from Norges Bank’s regional network shows that enterprises expect continued solid growth in production, but expect growth to be slightly lower than the level recorded so far. Many enterprises report that a shortage of labour and certain important input factors are limiting growth in production. Investment will increase, but at a slower rate than earlier. Selling prices are rising rapidly for products for businesses, but the rise is more moderate for consumer goods. Household spending on goods fell by a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.1 per cent from March to April, after rising by 0.8 per cent the previous month. Statistics from the real estate industry show that house prices rose by 14.4 per cent in the year to May 2007, down from 16.3 per cent in April. House price statistics from the Oslo Housing and Savings Society showed an easing of the twelve-month rise from April to May. Household debt accumulation remains high. According to building statistics, housing starts rose by 4.3 per cent from January to April 2007 compared with the same period one year earlier. In the first four months of the year, commercial building starts measured in square metres were 15.2 per cent higher than in the same period last year.   Charts and background material    Press release Norges Bank increases the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 4.25 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to raise its key policy rate (sight deposit rate) by 0.25 percentage point to 4.25 per cent with effect from 31 May 2007. The Norwegian economy is still booming and growth remains strong. Consumer price inflation has varied somewhat in recent months, but the overall rate of increase has been approximately as expected. Underlying inflation is estimated at between 1 and 1½ per cent. Cost inflation is rising in line with expectations. Total domestic demand is growing at a brisk pace, with particularly strong growth in household consumption. Employment has increased at a somewhat faster rate than expected, while unemployment is in line with projections. According to the strategy in Monetary Policy Report 1/07, the key policy rate should lie in the interval 4 - 5 per cent in the period to the publication of the next report on 27 June, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. The key policy rate will be increased gradually so that we can assess the effects of interest rate changes and other new information on economic developments. Outlook and risk factors In Monetary Policy Report 1/07, CPI inflation was projected to fall markedly in spring and remain low in the period to autumn, primarily reflecting the fall in electricity prices from the high levels prevailing in 2006. As the effect of lower electricity prices unwinds and cost inflation rises, inflation is likely to pick up and near the inflation target of 2½ per cent from next year. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, inflation is projected to rise gradually to around 2 per cent at the beginning of 2008. Major shifts in import patterns, weaker global growth, stronger domestic competition, sustained higher productivity growth or a stronger krone exchange rate may result in lower-than-expected inflation. On the other hand, capacity utilisation, output and employment have increased markedly over the past year, which may result in a faster-than-projected increase in prices and costs. Since the publication of the latest Report, new information shows stronger growth in Europe and China, and despite weaker growth in the US, the risk of a global downturn seems to have diminished. In Norway, growth in demand and employment has been somewhat stronger than expected, but at the same time, the supply of labour has increased to a further extent. Provided that the krone exchange rate does not prove to be considerably stronger than assumed in the Report, domestic and external price developments indicate that the risk of a new and sustained fall in prices for imported consumer goods has diminished. At the same time, the results of this year’s wage negotiations are consistent with projections published in March. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information since the previous monetary policy meeting on 25 April: Global growth is high. Economic growth in the euro area and China seems to be stronger than expected earlier, while growth in the US has been somewhat weaker than expected. There is still uncertainty surrounding the state of the US housing market. The situation in financial markets has remained stable. Equity prices have advanced both in Norway and internationally. Oil prices have increased and the Brent Blend spot price has reached USD 71 per barrel. Futures prices for delivery at end-2008 are USD 72 per barrel, approximately unchanged compared with the previous monetary policy meeting. The central banks in the UK and New Zealand have increased their official policy rates. Interest rate hikes are expected in several other countries through the year. Both short-term and long-term interest rate expectations have increased among our trading partners. In Norway, interest rate expectations have shown a somewhat smaller increase. The import-weighted krone exchange rate has appreciated by 0.3 per cent. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index (CPI) was 0.3 per cent in April, down from 1.1 per cent in March. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, consumer price inflation (CPI-ATE) was 1.4 per cent the past twelve months. The year-on-year rise in inflation measured by a trimmed mean of the rise in the sub-indices in the CPI was 1.2 per cent, while the rise was 1.3 per cent measured by a weighted median. In the Revised National Budget for 2007, nominal underlying spending growth is estimated at 7.8 per cent between 2006 and 2007, after rising by 4.4 per cent in the previous year. The non-oil budget deficit is estimated at 2.5 per cent measured as a percentage of mainland GDP. The structural deficit is estimated to increase by NOK 11.7 billion to NOK 67.8 billion, i.e. 3.8 per cent of the capital in the Government Pension Fund – Global. Growth in local government revenues is estimated at 9.5 per cent in 2006 and at close to 4 per cent in 2007. According to preliminary quarterly national accounts figures, mainland GDP grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 per cent between the fourth quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007. Excluding electricity production, growth was 1.3 per cent in the same period. The figures indicate sustained high growth in consumption, housing investment and exports. Seasonally adjusted, business investment remained virtually unchanged during this period. The wage settlement for the central government sector provides a general pay increase of 1.5 per cent. The carry-over into 2007 was 2.9 per cent. The local government wage settlement provides a general pay increase of 1.4 per cent in addition to the 1.4 per cent increase that was awarded in the 2006 settlement. The carry-over into 2007 was 1.7 per cent. Wage drift comes in addition to carry-over and the general increases. In April, seasonally adjusted, registered unemployment was 2.0 per cent of the labour force, or unchanged on the March figure. As measured by Statistics Norway’s labour force survey (LFS), seasonally adjusted unemployment was 2.7 per cent of the labour force in March (three-month period February – April), unchanged from February. The number employed increased by 13 000 between December (November – January) to March (February – April). According to new orders statistics for the building and construction industry, the value of new orders increased by 15 per cent between the first quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007. The value of total order backlogs rose by 19 per cent in the same period. The value of new manufacturing orders was 31 per cent higher in the first quarter of 2007 than one year earlier. The increase in the value of order backlogs was 47.5 per cent in the same period. The manufacturing production index rose by 4.7 per cent between the first quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007. Statistics Norway’s business tendency survey for the first quarter of 2007 shows a continued increase in production volume, order backlogs, employment and capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector. Enterprises’ debt and liquid assets is still on the rise. Prices for traditional goods exports rose by 6.4 per cent between the first quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of this year. Import prices for traditional goods rose by 6.9 per cent in the same period. First-quarter income accounts for the household sector show an increase in household real disposable income of a good 5 per cent between the first quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007. In the same period, household nominal wage income increased by a good 9 per cent. TNS Gallup’s trend indicator, which measures households’ assessment of their financial situation and the Norwegian economy, is now at its highest level since the first quarter of 2005. The volume of turnover in the retail industry, excluding motor vehicles and petrol, showed a seasonally adjusted increase of 1.3 per cent between February and March, after rising by 0.2 per cent in the previous month. In 2006, household net borrowing came to NOK 60.9 billion. As a result of substantial gains in securities and foreign exchange markets, household net financial assets nevertheless rose by NOK 31.2 billion. Household domestic debt (C2) increased by 11.9 per cent in the year to March 2007. Statistics from the real estate industry show a year-on-year rise in house prices of 16.3 per cent in April 2007, down from a year-on-year rise of 17.4 per cent in March. According to building area statistics, housing starts fell by 2.4 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period one year earlier. Measured by utility floor space the increase was 4.5 per cent. The year-on-year rise in the cost index for housing construction was 7.6 per cent in April, up from 6.3 per cent in March. Charts and background material                    Press release Norges Bank keeps the key policy rate unchanged Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to leave the key policy rate unchanged. Norges Bank’s key policy rate, the sight deposit rate, remains at 4.00 per cent. Charts - monetary policy meeting (pdf, 147 kB) Economic developments have been broadly in line with the projections in the Monetary Policy Report published in March. The Norwegian economy is still in an upturn and booming. Consumer price inflation has been somewhat higher than expected, but has primarily been fuelled by prices that show wide monthly variations. As expected, cost inflation seems to be on the rise.  The key policy rate has been raised by 2¼ percentage points to 4 per cent since summer 2005. Consumer price inflation is lower than the inflation target, but there are prospects that inflation will gradually pick up. Economic growth is buoyant but, on balance, new information since the previous monetary policy meeting does not warrant a departure from the monetary policy strategy presented in March. According to the strategy in Monetary Policy Report 1/07, the key policy rate should lie in the interval 4 - 5 per cent in the period to the publication of the next report on 27 June, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. The key policy rate will be increased gradually so that we can assess the effects of interest rate changes and other new information on economic developments. The Executive Board considered the alternative of increasing the interest rate at today’s meeting, but decided that it was appropriate to leave the key policy rate unchanged. Outlook and risk factors Underlying inflation was fairly stable for a long period and has been estimated at between 1 and 1½ per cent. Various indicators of underlying inflation were in the upper end of this interval in March. A majority of enterprises in our regional network now expect a faster rise in prices over the next twelve months than in the previous twelve months. In Monetary Policy Report 1/07, CPI inflation was projected to fall markedly in spring and remain low in the period to autumn, primarily reflecting the fall in electricity prices from the high levels prevailing in 2006. As the effect of lower electricity prices unwinds and cost inflation rises, inflation is likely to pick up. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, underlying inflation is projected to rise gradually through the year. In the Report, it was pointed out that major shifts in import patterns, weaker global growth, stronger domestic competition, sustained higher productivity growth or a stronger krone exchange rate may result in lower-than-expected inflation. On the other hand, capacity utilisation, output and employment have increased markedly over the past year, which may result in a faster-than-projected increase in prices and costs. Since the publication of the latest Report, new information shows somewhat stronger growth in Europe and China, but slightly weaker growth in the US. Many enterprises in our regional network report that prices for goods imported from Asia have increased. Provided that the krone exchange rate does not prove to be considerably stronger than assumed in the Report, domestic and external price developments indicate that the risk of a new and sustained fall in prices for imported consumer goods has diminished. At the same time, the first results of this year’s wage negotiations are consistent with projections published in March. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information since the previous monetary policy meeting on 15 March: Global growth remains strong. In the US, the uncertainty surrounding the state of the economy and particularly the housing market has increased. At the same time, there are signs that economic growth in the euro area and China is stronger than expected earlier. The situation in international financial market has stabilised since the turbulence prevailing at the end of February and the beginning of March. Equity prices have advanced and the decline has been reversed. Oil prices have edged up. Futures prices for delivery at end-2008 have now reached USD 71, compared with USD 66 around the previous monetary policy meeting. The European Central Bank and the central banks in the US, Japan, the UK and Sweden have held monetary policy meetings and left their official policy rates unchanged. Interest rate hikes are expected in several other countries in the period to autumn 2007. Both short-term and long-term interest rate expectations have increased among our trading partners. In the US, market participants expect interest rate cuts in the latter half of the year. In Norway, interest rate expectations have increased, particularly one year ahead.   The import-weighed krone exchange rate has appreciated by 0.5 per cent. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.1 per cent in March, i.e. an increase of 0.3 percentage point on the previous month. Inflation adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) was 1.5 per cent. Inflation measured by a trimmed mean of the rise in the sub-indices in the CPI was 1.4 per cent, the same rate of increase as measured by a weighted median. The Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions/Confederation of Vocational Unions have finalised this year’s wage settlement. The outcome includes a general hourly pay increase of NOK 2.50 and an additional hourly increase of NOK 1 for low-income groups. The Federation of Norwegian Commercial and the Service Enterprises and Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions/Confederation of Vocational Unions have negotiated wage settlements that under most agreements imply a general hourly pay increase between NOK 2.50 and 3.50. Seasonally adjusted, registered unemployment fell by 0.1 percentage point to 2.0 per cent of the labour forces between February and March. As measured by Statistics Norway’s labour force survey (LFS), seasonally adjusted unemployment declined to 2.7 per cent of the labour force in the period December 2006 to February 2007. In the same period, the number employed increased by 18 000. Manufacturing production increase by a seasonally adjusted 1.3 per cent in the three months to February, compared with the previous three-month period. Growth in debt and liquid assets remains very high for the enterprise sector.   Information from Norges Bank’s regional network shows continued solid growth in demand and production. Commercial services have shown the strongest rate of growth, but growth is also vigorous in manufacturing and the construction industry. Market prospects for the next six months are positive even though growth is widely expected to slow somewhat. A lack of spare capacity is one of the main factors behind the expectations of slower growth. Wage growth is expected to be markedly higher than in the beginning of 2006. Expectations have shown a particularly strong increase in retail trade and the construction industry, compared with 2006. The enterprises in the regional network report a pronounced increase in prices for inputs and commercial services and expect a faster rise in selling prices.  Household consumption of goods is growing at a fast pace. Unadjusted, the retail trade index was 7.2 per cent higher in February 2007 than in the same month one year earlier, partly reflecting a high level of car sales. Statistics from the real estate industry show a 17.5 per cent rise in house prices between March 2006 and March 2007, down from 18.6 per cent in February. House price statistics from the Oslo Housing and Savings Society shows a faster year-on-year rise between February and March. According to building statistics, housing starts increased by 21.4 per cent in the first two months of the year, compared with the same period one year earlier. Household debt accumulation remains high.     Press release Norges Bank's overnight lending rate Norges Bank’s Executive Board has decided to set the overnight lending rate 1 percentage point higher than the sight deposit rate. The overnight lending rate has no monetary policy function, and the decision implies no change in Norges Bank’s monetary policy. It is the interest rate on banks’ deposits in Norges Bank (the sight deposit rate) that is Norges Bank’s key policy rate. The difference between Norges Bank’s sight deposit rate and overnight lending rate is thereby reduced from 2 percentage points to 1 percentage point. Changes in the overnight lending rate will hereafter automatically accompany changes in Norges Bank’s key policy rate (the sight deposit rate). The decision is effective from 16 March 2007.    Press release Norges Bank increases the key policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to 3.75 per cent Norges Bank’s Executive Board decided today to raise its key policy rate by 0.25 New information since Inflation Report 3/06 was published in November indicates that growth in the economy may be somewhat higher than projected. A steadily rising number of enterprises are facing labour shortages. Wage growth now appears to be rising at a somewhat faster rate than expected. The rate of increase in house prices and debt growth remains high. Moreover, underlying inflation has been somewhat higher than projected in the Inflation Report, and is now estimated to lie in a range of a little less than 1¼ per cent and up to 1¾ per cent. The risk of an imminent and pronounced slowdown in the world economy is now judged to be somewhat smaller than earlier. Monetary policy influences the economy with a lag. Even though the interest rate has been increased considerably since summer 2005, it is still lower than what we consider to be a neutral level. The interest rate may gradually be raised to a more normal level, although it is unlikely that rates will be raised at every monetary policy meeting. The interest rate will thus continue to be raised in small, not too frequent steps. According to the prevailing monetary policy strategy, the sight deposit rate should be in the interval 3¼ - 4¼ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 15 March, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with projections. The interest rate was raised in November and December. The Executive Board considered the alternative of leaving the interest rate unchanged. On balance, however, new information indicated that the key policy rate should be raised at the present meeting.  Outlook and risk factors The analyses in Inflation Report 3/06 suggest that the interest rate may gradually be raised to a more normal level, although it is unlikely that rates will be raised at every monetary policy meeting. Inflation was projected to remain low to the end of 2006 and into 2007, but inflation was expected to pick up in particular from the latter half of 2007 and into 2008 as a result of high capacity utilisation, rising wage growth and somewhat slower productivity growth. In the Report, it was pointed out that pronounced shifts in the import pattern, a strong krone and intensified domestic competition may lead to lower-than-projected inflation. It was also pointed out that a long period of low real interest rates may result in higher growth in output and employment and higher-than projected price and cost inflation. The strong figures for growth and employment may tilt towards a faster-than-projected rate of increase in prices and wages. New information since the publication of the previous Inflation Report may suggest that the risk that inflation will be considerably lower than projected in the period ahead has subsided somewhat. Economic developments The Executive Board has placed emphasis on the following new information, which has emerged since the previous monetary policy meeting on 13 December: Growth in the world economy has been somewhat stronger than projected in Inflation Report 3/06. In the US, the euro area, the UK and Sweden, growth has slackened less than expected. Activity in many Asian countries appears to remain buoyant. Some indicators point to weaker growth in Japan. Brent Blend spot prices have declined markedly, from USD 62 to USD 55 per barrel. Futures prices for delivery at end-2008 are now at USD 59 per barrel, i.e. a decline of USD 9. Prices for metal commodities have also fallen.  The fall in energy prices through autumn has pushed down consumer price inflation in many countries. Core inflation is low. In the UK, inflation has edged up. International stock markets have advanced. The benchmark index on the Oslo Stock Exchange has increased by about 9 per cent. Both short-term and long-term interest rates have risen among our trading partners. Interest rate expectations have increased somewhat more in Norway than abroad, particularly about one year ahead. Policy rates in Switzerland, Sweden, Iceland and the UK have been raised by 0.25 percentage point. In the period to autumn 2007, policy rates are expected to be raised further in several countries. In the US, the tightening cycle appears to have come to an end and the market expects an interest rate reduction in the course of 2007. The import-weighted krone exchange rate (I-44) has depreciated by near 3 per cent and is now close to the projection in the Inflation Report. The year-on-year rise in consumer prices was 2.2 per cent in December, i.e. a deceleration of 0.4 percentage point on the previous month. Adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products, consumer price inflation (CPI-ATE) was 1.0 per cent in December, and 1.2 per cent when further adjusted for lower maximum day-care rates. By this measure, inflation has increased by 0.2 percentage point since November. The rate of increase in prices measured by a trimmed mean of sub-indices in the consumer price index was 1.6 per cent in December. As measured by the weighted median, the rate of increase was 1.9 per cent. According to Statistics Norway’s external trade statistics for the fourth quarter of 2006, import prices have increased, particularly for commodities, but also for intermediate and consumer goods. The rate of increase in export prices, excluding oil and gas, is still very high. The volume of traditional goods exports increased by a seasonally adjusted 2.7 per cent on the previous quarter, while the volume of imports increased by 6.1 per cent. In manufacturing, production growth is strong, particularly for intermediate and investment goods. The rate of debt accumulation in the enterprise sector is rising, and enterprises are rapidly accumulating liquid assets. Registered unemployment adjusted for seasonal variations remained unchanged at 2.2 per cent of the labour force in December. Seasonally adjusted unemployment, as measured by Statistics Norway’s labour force survey (LFS), has shown a further fall. In the period between September and November 2006, the unemployment rate was 3.1 per cent. Employment has exhibited a marked increase. Between July and October, the number employed increased by 24 000.  Household spending on goods continued to rise in November, with twelve-month growth at 5.8 per cent. Activity remains firm in the housing market. According to Statistics Norway’s building statistics, housing starts increased by 2.3 per cent in the period between January and November 2006, compared with the same period one year earlier. Housing construction costs rose by 5.5 per cent in the year to December 2006. According to real estate agency statistics, house prices increased by 18.6 per cent in the same period. Growth in household borrowing remains high. Charts - monetary policy meeting (151kb)    "

      "   Norges Bank's press conference of 1 November 2000 Interest rates were left unchanged at Norges Bank’s Executive Board meeting on 1 November. The interest rate on banks’ sight deposits with Norges Bank and the overnight lending rate therefore remain at 7.00 per cent and 9.00 per cent respectively. The objective of monetary policy is stability in the exchange rate against European currencies. Norges Bank does not have the instruments to fine-tune the exchange rate, but when setting interest rates the central bank places emphasis on the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability: price and cost inflation must over time be reduced to the level aimed at by the euro area. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions. The analyses in Norges Bank’s inflation reports, together with its continuous evaluation of the outlook for price and cost inflation and conditions in money and foreign exchange markets, provide the basis for decisions concerning monetary policy instruments. Norges Bank’s assessment of prospects for economic developments was last presented on 28 September in the September 2000 Inflation Report. The projections in the Inflation Report indicated that price and cost inflation in Norway would gradually slow. According to the assumptions upon which the report was based, consumer price inflation in Norway could decline to just over 2 per cent at the end of 2002. The shape of the projection curves suggested that price inflation might be lower still in 2003. The krone has appreciated against the euro since Norges Bank’s Executive Board held its last monetary policy meeting on 20 September. The effective import-weighted krone exchange rate, which is a better indicator of international price impulses affecting the Norwegian economy, has also strengthened somewhat since the last monetary policy meeting, but is about 2 per cent lower than it was at the end of 1999. New information regarding economic developments yields a mixed picture. Price inflation is high. The year-on-year rise in the consumer price index was 3.5 per cent in September. The increase was broad-based, and somewhat higher than expected. Credit growth is high. Local government, non-financial enterprises and households are all contributing to credit growth. The labour market is tight. In isolation, the central government budget proposal may imply somewhat higher consumer price inflation in 2001 and 2002 than previously estimated by the Bank. In the longer term, this effect may be curbed, as higher labour costs will contribute to lower employment in the business sector. On the other hand, there are now signs of slower growth in consumption and a levelling off of house prices. There are also indications that growth in the global economy may be somewhat lower in the future, partly because of the high oil price. The interest rate rises so far this year contribute to curbing growth in demand. This will gradually translate into lower consumer price inflation than would otherwise have been the case. There is uncertainty regarding the overall effect on price inflation of the various forces acting on the economy. Norges Bank will analyse developments more closely in the Inflation Report to be presented in December. In the light of recent trends in the economy and the current balance of risks, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be a reduction is the same as the probability of an increase.
